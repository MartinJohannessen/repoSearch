We also measured motivations to comply with preventive measures in Study 2.\n\nResults\nWe show that people high in conspiracy mentality are likely to engage in non‐normative prevention behaviours (Study 1), but are less willing to comply with extreme preventive behaviours that are government‐driven (Study 2). However, we demonstrate that a perceived risk to oneself (risk of death) and a motivation to protect oneself can act as a suppressor: Conspiracy mentality is linked with an increase in the perception of risk to oneself, which, in turn, is associated with normative compliance. We also find that perceived risk of death explains the relationship between conspiracy mentality and non‐normative prevention behaviours.\n\nConclusions\nOur studies showcase how people high in conspiracy theorizing may (dis)engage with prevention behaviours, but that perceived risk and motivation to protect oneself could increase these individuals’ compliance.\n\nStatement of contribution\nWhat is already known on this subject?\n\nConspiracy theory is positively linked to adoption of non‐normative behaviours but negatively to normative ones.\nConspiracy beliefs are in part linked to self‐serving interests.\nWhat does this study add?\n\nPositive link between conspiracy and non‐normative preventive behaviours is mediated by perceived death risk.\nConspiracy is linked negatively to normative preventive health behaviours.\nThis latter link is alleviated by perceived death risk and self‐protective motivations.\nBackground\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 (commonly known as COVID‐19) a pandemic (WHO, 2020). At the time of writing, there have been over 2 million confirmed cases worldwide (Dong et al., 2020). Preventive health measures to curb the spread of the virus, implemented by governments around the world, include recommendations of barrier gestures (i.e., frequent hand washing, avoiding shaking hands) to enforced lockdowns where residents are unable to leave their homes except for essential travel («Coronavirus: recommendations», 2020; Decree regulating movements, 2020). Whilst there are likely to be numerous contributors to (dis)engagement with preventive health measures, one important potential factor could be conspiracy theorizing where people believe power actors are plotting something sinister concerning the virus. In the current research, we explored the relationship between conspiracy mentality and normative (i.e., government‐driven) and non‐normative (i.e., not government‐driven) preventive behaviours to tackle COVID‐19. We also focused on the role of perceived risk of COVID‐19 and motivations for preventive behaviours. We examined how the perception of personal risk and the motivation to protect oneself may enhance both normative and non‐normative preventive behaviours among people with higher conspiracy mentality.\n\nThe psychology of conspiracy theories\nConspiracy theories are defined as explanations for events that implicate secretive and powerful groups, who cover‐up information to suit their own interests (Douglas et al., 2017). Conspiracy theories develop around significant events, such as the death of Princess Diana, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, or the Zika virus (Douglas & Sutton, 2008; Klofstad et al., 2019; Swami et al., 2010; Wood, 2018). COVID‐19 provides an ideal context for conspiracy theories to develop, as they tend to arise in threatening moments of crisis that breed uncertainty (van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017). Indeed, a range of COVID‐19 conspiracy theories exist, such as the proposal that the virus is a bio‐weapon engineered by the CIA or that it was introduced to make money from its vaccine (Conspiracy Watch, 2020; Duncan, 2020).\n\nBelief in conspiracy theories is common. A 2019 study found that 43% of French people believe that health officials are hiding negative effects of vaccines and 27% believe in the Illuminati (Ifop, 2019). In a recent survey on conspiracy beliefs surrounding COVID‐19, 26% of French respondents believe it was created in a laboratory (Ifop, 2020). Researchers consistently find that endorsing one conspiracy theory is strongly predictive of endorsing many others (e.g., Swami et al., 2010, 2011), even when those conspiracy theories are mutually exclusive (Wood et al., 2012). These findings have led several scholars to argue that a general world view – a conspiracy mentality – may underpin conspiracy beliefs (e.g., Bruder et al., 2013; Imhoff & Bruder, 2014; Moscovici, 1987). Viewing the world as full of conspiracies can promote belief in conspiracy theories about specific events, like COVID‐19.\n\nSubscribing to conspiracy beliefs can impact citizens in significant ways (see van Prooijen & Douglas, 2018). For example, researchers have found that exposure to conspiracy information can reduce intentions to engage in politics (Jolley & Douglas, 2014a). However, others have discovered that conspiracy theories can motivate people to become politically active (Imhoff & Bruder, 2014; Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018). In resolving these contradictions, Imhoff et al. (2020) have recently shown that endorsing a conspiracy worldview both decreases intentions to engage in normative (legal) political acts (e.g., voting) and, at the same time, increases non‐normative (illegal) political acts (e.g., violent protest). They argue that conspiracy beliefs may lead people to disengage from normative methods of interacting with society and thus non‐normative actions become the best option.\n\nIn a similar vein, Lamberty and Imhoff (2018) found that conspiracy mentality predicted a preference for alternative rather than biomedical therapies perceived as promoted by high power institutions. Indeed, in an experimental study, a (fictional) biomedical approach was rated more positively by those high in conspiracy mentality when the approach was supported by a powerless (vs. powerful) agent. Other studies have also demonstrated conspiracy beliefs lead to a lower respect of prevention and cure measures using biomedical therapies (e.g., HIV and child vaccination; Bogart & Thorburn, 2005; Jolley & Douglas, 2014b). Taken together, these studies provide evidence that people who subscribe to conspiracy theorizing are more likely to engage in non‐normative behaviours, because such behaviours are often supported by the low‐power underdog rather than a high power entity, such as the government. It is theoretically plausible, therefore, that individuals high in conspiracy mentality may prefer non‐normative preventive behaviours to stop the spread of COVID‐19 and be less supportive of normative, government‐driven measures.\n\nRisk perception and conspiracy mentality\nWhilst conspiracy theorizing may discourage people from following normative prevention behaviour, perception of greater risk could suppress this effect. Previous work has showcased that conspiracy believers are motivated by self‐interests (e.g., Cichocka et al., 2016) and adopt self‐serving behaviours (e.g., Jolley et al., 2019). Klofstad et al. (2019) found conspiracy beliefs were positively correlated with increased concern about Zika. Subscribing to conspiracy theories has also been shown to be associated with psychological factors that could increase feelings of personal risk, such as paranoia (Bruder et al., 2013). One of the defining features of paranoia is increased perceptions of hostility and interpreting ambiguous information in a negative light (Combs et al., 2013), which could result in people high in conspiracy mentality perceiving greater risks to themselves associated with COVID‐19.\n\nConspiracy theories also appeal to people who are high in narcissism (Cichocka et al., 2016). People high in narcissism express less empathy towards others (Watson & Morris, 1991) and feel their own lives are more important than other people’s (Campbell & Foster, 2007). As a result, conspiracy theories can motivate people to want to protect themselves. For example, people who are high in conspiracy theorizing are more likely to accept political violence towards high powered agents, such as the government, in order to protect themselves (Uscinski & Parent, 2014). Thus, people with heighted conspiracy mentality may only be motivated by the risks associated with COVID‐19 if they perceive it as affecting their own health, rather than that of people in society at large.\n\nRisk perception and preventive health behaviours\nThe perception of risk has long been studied in the field of health psychology as a necessary motivator of preventive health behaviours (van der Pligt, 1998), ranging from condom use to dental hygiene (Sheeran et al., 2014). Relevant to the current study, a meta‐analysis of 34 studies found a moderate positive correlation between perceived risk of infection and the decision to vaccinate (Brewer et al., 2007). Furthermore, perceived risk increased the decision to vaccinate during the swine flu (A/H1N1) pandemic of 2009 ‐ 2010 (Setbon & Raude, 2010). Vaccination is a preventive, self‐protective health behaviour with similar aims to the barrier gestures and confinement orders currently being used to combat COVID‐19. Thus, we predict that perceived risk will increase the self‐protective, preventive behaviours that are currently available to individuals. In sum, conspiracy mentality is likely to increase the perceived risk from COVID‐19, which may then translate into compliance with preventive health behaviours, but only with the goal of protecting oneself.\n\nCurrent research\nIn two studies, we tested whether conspiracy mentality predicts engagement in non‐normative preventive behaviours, whilst decreasing willingness to engage in normative, government‐driven, behaviours to tackle COVID‐19. We also explored the role of perceived risk to self and self‐serving motivation to protect oneself from COVID‐19. Four hypotheses were proposed:\n\nHypothesis 1.Conspiracy mentality will be positively associated with non‐normative preventive behaviours (Study 1).\n\nHypothesis 2.Conspiracy mentality will be negatively associated with normative preventive behaviours (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nHypothesis 3.The perception of personal risk will act as a mediator between conspiracy mentality and non‐normative preventive behaviour (Study 1).\n\nHypothesis 4a.Conspiracy mentality will increase the perception of personal risk, which will act as a suppressor between conspiracy mentality and normative preventive behaviour (Study 1).\n\nHypothesis 4b.Conspiracy mentality will increase the perception of personal risk, increasing the motivation to protect oneself, which will act as a suppressor between conspiracy mentality and normative preventive behaviour (Study 2).\n\nSTUDY 1\nThis study was conducted on 9 March 2020 in France. At this point, there were 1,412 confirmed cases in France, 30 deaths had been reported (Dong et al., 2020), and only gatherings of more than 1,000 people were prohibited (measures to fight against Covid‐19, 2020). Additionally, barrier gestures (not kissing or shaking hands) were strongly recommended by the government as ways to stop the spread of the virus («Coronavirus: recommendations», 2020). Thus, not shaking hands and not kissing were the normative preventive behaviours at this point. However, certain people were also beginning to take more extreme non‐normative measures, such as no longer going to public places. Study 1 aims to study the link between conspiracy mentality, risk, and the adoption of both normative and non‐normative social distancing behaviours. We hypothesize that conspiracy is linked to more non‐normative preventive behaviours (H1) but to less normative preventive health behaviours (H2). Moreover, we predict that the perception of risk for oneself may lead individuals to adopt more preventive behaviours, resulting in a mediation effect for non‐normative behaviours (H3) and a suppressor effect for normative behaviours (H4a).\n\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe recruited 762 French participants (665 women, 93 men, 4 others), aged between 18 and 67 years (M = 23.89, SD = 9.96) by posting the questionnaire to Facebook groups associated with different French towns, universities, and political groups. Due to the quickly changing situation around governmental recommendations on COVID‐19, all data were collected on the same day. A sensitivity analysis was conducted which demonstrated that the study is suitably powered to detect at least a small two‐tailed correlation (|r| = .07), with an alpha of 0.05% and a power of .80 (G*Power; Faul et al., 2007).\n\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited to participate in an online study, which was presented as a study on science and COVID‐19. After giving consent, participants answered questions on conspiracy mentality, risk perception regarding COVID‐19, prevention behaviours adopted, and sociodemographic information.1\n\nMeasures\nConspiracy mentality\nFive items (from Bruder et al., 2013; used in French by Lantian et al., 2016) measured conspiracy mentality, on an 11‐point scale ranging from 1 = 0%– certainly not to 11 = 100%– certain. Though its psychometric properties are adequate, Swami et al. (2017) recommend assessing Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire’s structure whenever a global score is to be computed. A principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation indicated the presence of two factors, explaining 75% of the total variance. The first factor, which we called scepticism, included two items: ‘I think that many very important things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about.’; and ‘I think that politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions.’, r = .59, p < .001. The second factor, which we called conspiracy, included three items: ‘I think that government agencies closely monitor all citizens.’; ‘I think that events which superficially seem to lack a connection are often the result of secret activities.’; and ‘I think that there are secret organizations that greatly influence political decisions.’, ⍵ = .81. Since the objective of this article is to study the impact of conspiracy, we will focus on this dimension for the analyses and discussion that follow.2\n\nPerceived risk\nThe perceived risk of contamination of the French population (‘What percentage of the French population could be contaminated by COVID‐19 this year?’), of personal contamination (‘What is the percentage risk of you being contaminated with COVID‐19 this year?’), and of death (‘If you were contaminated, what would be the percentage risk that you would die from COVID‐19?’) were measured by single items, as a percentage (from Setbon & Raude, 2010).\n\nPreventive health behaviours\nParticipants were asked to indicate for seven social distancing behaviours the extent to which they were engaging in these behaviours compared to before the coronavirus crisis, on a scale ranging from 1 = much less than before to 9 = much more than before. Principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation confirmed the presence of two factors. The first factor referred to normative prevention behaviours (‘kissing someone’; ‘shaking hands’), r = .78, p < .001. The second factor referred to non‐normative prevention behaviours (‘talking to people’; ‘taking public transportation’; ‘going to a restaurant’; ‘going to a gathering in a closed place’; ‘going to a gathering in an open place’), ⍵ = .78. The scores were reversed so that a higher score corresponds to more adoption of preventive behaviour.\n\nResults\nLinks between conspiracy, perceived risks, and preventive behaviours\nThe means, standard deviations, and correlations are reported in Table 1 (data from both studies are available at: https://osf.io/ucf4m/). Conspiracy was positively correlated with the adoption of non‐normative prevention behaviours (supporting H1). In contrast, no association was observed with the adoption of normative prevention behaviours (not supporting H2). Furthermore, conspiracy was associated with a greater perception of risk of contamination of the French population, personal contamination, and risk of death (supporting H3 and H4a).\n\nTable 1.

To do so, we conducted a mediation analysis simultaneously considering the perceived risk of contamination of the French population, of the self, and the risk of death as mediators. This analysis was conducted with PROCESS (Hayes, 2013, model 4) with a bootstrap of 5,000 and a confidence interval of 95%.3\n\nThis analysis conducted on normative prevention behaviours showed an indirect effect of conspiracy through perceived risk of personal contamination, but not through perceived risk of contamination of the French population or through perceived risk of death, cf. Figure 1.\n\nimage\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nDirect and indirect effects of conspiracy on normative prevention behaviours.\n\nNote: Significant results are reported in bold. Cons = Conspiracy; CF = Contamination of the French Population; PC = Personal Contamination; DR = Death Risk; and NPB = Normative Prevention Behaviours.\n\nThis analysis conducted on non‐normative prevention behaviours showed a mediation effect through the risk of death, but not through risk of contamination of the French population or through personal contamination, cf. Figure 2.\n\nimage\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nDirect and indirect effects of conspiracy on non‐normative prevention behaviours.\n\nNote: Significant results are reported in bold. Cons = Conspiracy; CF = Contamination of the French Population; PC = Personal Contamination; DR = Death Risk; and NNPB = Non‐normative Prevention Behaviours.\n\nDiscussion\nSupporting H1, we found that conspiracy mentality is associated with more non‐normative prevention behaviours, although it is worth noting that the effect size was small. The hypothesized indirect effect of self‐perceived risk was observed, with the adoption of non‐normative behaviours explained by increased perception of risk of death (H3). However, H2 was not supported: Conspiracy mentality was unrelated to the adoption of normative prevention behaviours. Nevertheless, H4a was supported; there was an indirect effect of conspiracy on normative prevention behaviours via risk of self‐contamination. These results suggest that the higher people’s conspiracy mentality is, the more likely they are to adopt preventive behaviours when they perceive a risk to themselves. Furthermore, our results partially confirm that conspiracy believers are more likely to adopt non‐normative prevention behaviours, but not normative ones. The second study further explores the link between conspiracy mentality and the adoption of extreme prevention behaviour made normative by law (confinement). Furthermore, in order to confirm that conspiracy believers may be more inclined to adopt prevention behaviours for their personal benefit, we measured individuals’ motivations to comply with confinement.\n\nSTUDY 2\nStudy 2 was conducted during the first week of total confinement in France. The governmental confinement order started on March 17 at 12:00pm (Decree regulating movements, 2020), following an exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases. On March 18th, there were 9,134 confirmed cases and 244 deaths (Dong et al., 2020). French citizens were ordered to leave their houses only for essential items, required to complete a form stating the purpose of the trip and show it to any public safety officials that questioned them. At this point, behaviours like staying away from public places/transportation, thus obeying the confinement order, became normative. The second study examines the link between conspiracy mentality, risk, motivation for obeying the confinement order, and the adoption of normative preventive health behaviours, in this situation, compliance with confinement. We hypothesized that conspiracy mentality would be linked to less respect of confinement (H2), but that nevertheless, the perception of personal risk could lead to self‐protective motivation to obey the confinement order (H4b).\n\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe recruited 229 French participants (177 women, 51 men, 1 other), aged between 18 and 74 years (M = 26.91, SD = 12.46). All data were collected between 18th and 23rd March, the first week of confinement. A sensitivity analysis was conducted which demonstrated that the study is suitably powered to detect at least a small two‐tailed correlation (|r| = .13), with an alpha of 0.05% and a power of .80 (G*Power; Faul et al., 2007).\n\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited in the same manner as Study 1. After giving consent, participants were asked questions about conspiracy beliefs, the perception of risk related to COVID‐19, various elements related to confinement, and sociodemographic information.4\n\nMeasures\nVariables from Study 1\nWe used the same items to measure conspiracy mentality, ⍵ = .86,5 perceived risk of contamination for the French population, personal contamination, and death.\n\nConfinement compliance\nCompliance with the confinement rule was measured by a single item ‘To what extent do you comply with the confinement measures (limiting movement, limiting social contact)?’ on a 7‐point scale ranging from 1 = not all, to 7 = very much.\n\nMotivation to comply with confinement\nFive motivations were proposed, introduced by the question ‘What are your reasons for respecting these measures?’. For each motivation, participants had to answer using a 7‐point scale ranging from 1 = not at all to 7 = very much. The motivations were to protect: oneself (‘To protect myself from COVID‐19’); one's close relatives (‘To protect my close relatives (family, friends)’); vulnerable people (‘To protect people at risk (the elderly, people with certain chronic diseases)’); French people (‘To protect all French people’); and humanity (‘To protect humanity’).\n\nResults\nLinks between conspiracy, perceived risks, motivations, and confinement compliance\nThe means, standard deviations, and correlations are reported in Table 2. Supporting H2, conspiracy was negatively correlated with compliance with confinement. In addition, conspiracy was linked to a higher perceived risk of death, but not to other risks (of contamination of the French population and personal contamination, H4b). Furthermore, conspiracy was linked to a motivation to respect confinement in order to protect oneself, but was not linked to any other motivation (to protect one's relatives, vulnerable people, the French population, or humanity, H4b).\n\nTable 2.

Yzerbyt et al. (2018) call for testing the indirect effects of a relationship only if the different components of the model are significant. Considering the correlations presented above, we tested the serial mediation model with conspiracy as the predictor, perceived risk of death followed by the motivation to protect oneself as mediators, and compliance with confinement as the dependent variable (Hayes, 2013, model 6), with a 5,000 bootstrap and a 95% confidence interval. The indirect effect via perceived risk of death and motivation for oneself was significant, cf. Figure 3. The path through the perceived risk of death only, or through motivation for oneself only, was not significant.\n\nimage\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nDirect and indirect effects of conspiracy on the confinement compliance.\n\nNote: Significant results are reported in bold. Cons = Conspiracy; DR = Death Risk; MO = Motivation for Oneself; and CC = Confinement Compliance.\n\nDiscussion\nStudy 2 supported H2, that conspiracy mentality is linked to less compliance with confinement measures. The results also provided support for H4b, showing an indirect effect between conspiracy beliefs and compliance with confinement via perceived risk of death and self‐motivation. This indirect effect alleviated the negative link between conspiracy and non‐normative behaviour and thus led conspiracy believers to adopt more normative prevention behaviours.\n\nThis study therefore complements Study 1 by confirming that people with a heighted conspiracy mentality are less inclined to adopt more extreme and legal normative preventive behaviours. In addition, Study 2 supplements Study 1 by showing that the indirect link through the perception of risk is also underpinned by a motivation to protect oneself.\n\nGENERAL DISCUSSION\nThe present research examined the impact of conspiracy mentality on the adoption of non‐normative (i.e., not government‐driven) (H1) and normative (i.e., government‐driven) behaviours (H2). Study 1 provides support for H1: Those higher in conspiracy theorizing adopt more non‐normative social distancing behaviours, whereas unexpectedly, no link is observed with the normative behaviours (disconfirming H2). However, in Study 2, we do find support for H2 when the normative behaviour is extreme: People who have heightened conspiracy mentality are less likely to comply with confinement. Conspiracy mentality is, therefore, associated with engagement with non‐government‐driven behaviours, and there is evidence to suggest it reduces extreme government‐driven preventive behaviour.\n\nWe also examined the factors and motivations underlying the adoption of preventive behaviours, particularly perceived risk to self (H3 and H4) and motivation to protect oneself (H4b). Hypotheses were supported: The adoption of preventive behaviours among people with a higher conspiracy mentality was associated with a perception of risk for oneself. Indeed, Study 1 showed that perceived risk of death mediated the link between conspiracy mentality and non‐normative behaviours. An indirect effect through perceived risk of personal contamination also contributed to reinforcing the link between conspiracy and normative behaviours. In Study 2, conspiracy mentality was associated with the perception of risk of death, and thus the motivation to protect oneself, contributing to an increased link with confinement compliance.\n\nConspiracy mentality and (dis)engagement in extreme behaviours\nWe demonstrate that a key factor in whether people high in conspiracy mentality engage with COVID‐19 preventive behaviour is the normative context of that behaviour (i.e., who recommends the behaviour). We found that preventive behaviours, such as avoiding social gatherings, were supported when they were not government‐driven (Study 1), but when they were government‐driven, those high in conspiracy mentality disengaged (Study 2). Although the effect sizes found in our studies were small, our studies test in a real context the influence of the source recommending prevention health behaviours. When these behaviours are not advocated by the government, people with a strong conspiracy mentality adopt them, but quickly disengage as soon as they become official, government recommendations. This finding supports previous work that has found people high in conspiracy mentality engage in counter‐normative behaviours (e.g., extremist protest) but not in normative behaviours (e.g., voting, Imhoff et al., 2020). By mobilizing similar non‐normative behaviours in Study 1, which became normative in Study 2, our studies shed new light on the impact of the source of preventive behaviours. Thus, people with a greater conspiracy mentality may also adopt behaviours that are beneficial and effective in terms of prevention (the unofficial behaviours in Study 1) if they are not defended by an official authority.\n\nAdditionally, an unexpected factor seems to influence our results: the extreme nature of the preventive behaviour. At the time of Study 1, the normative, government‐driven behaviours were simply to stop shaking hands and kissing, relatively common behaviours. However, non‐normative behaviours in Study 1 (avoiding public places), which became normative behaviour in Study 2 (confinement), were extreme. Previous research has linked conspiracy mentality with the desire to feel different from others (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2017; Lantian et al., 2017). Desire for uniqueness leads individuals to adopt atypical behaviours (Lynn & Snyder, 2001). Perhaps, then, uniqueness seeking may lead conspiracy theory endorsers to only engage with extreme health behaviours, engagement in non‐normative behaviours or disengagement in normative behaviours, but may not affect common, everyday behaviours.\n\nThe role of the perceived threat and motivation to protect oneself\nWhilst those who subscribe to conspiracy theories disengage with government supported behaviours, we also demonstrate, for the first time in literature to our knowledge, that increases in perceived risk, specifically of death, are linked to greater adoption of government‐driven behaviours. This perception of risk reinforces engagement in non‐normative preventive behaviours and attenuates disengagement with normative ones. Furthermore, when asked about their motivations for obeying the confinement order, those higher in conspiracy beliefs were more willing to act to protect themselves. Thus, these findings are important because they provide insight into the factors, notably protecting oneself, that may lead to the adoptio",

Introduction\nWe are in the middle of a global Covid-19 pandemic, which is inflicting two kinds of shocks on countries: a\nhealth shock and an economic shock. Given the nature of the disease which is highly contagious, the ways to\ncontain the spread include policy actions such as imposition of social distancing, self-isolation at home,\nclosure of institutions, and public facilities, restrictions on mobility and even lock-down of an entire country.\nThese actions can potentially lead to dire consequences for economies around the world. In other words,\neffective containment of the disease requires the economy of a country to stop its normal functioning. This\nhas triggered fears of a deep and prolonged global recession. On April 9, the chief of International Monetary\nFund, Kristalina Georgieva said that the year 2020 could see the worst global economic fallout since the\nGreat Depression in the 1930s, with over 170 countries likely to experience negative per capita GDP growth\ndue to the raging coronavirus pandemic.34\nThe world has witnessed several epidemics such as the Spanish Flu of 1918, outbreak of HIV/AIDS, SARS\n(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and Ebola. In the past,\nIndia has had to deal with diseases such as the small pox, plague and polio. All of these individually have\nbeen pretty severe episodes. However the Covid-19 which originated in China in December 2019 and over\nthe next few months rapidly spread to almost all countries of the world can potentially turn out to be the\nbiggest health crisis in our history. Many experts have already called this a Black Swan event for the global\neconomy.\n\n1Director, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR), Mumbai.\n2Assistant Professor of Economics, IGIDR, Mumbai. Corresponding author, email: rajeswari@igidr.ac.in.\nThe authors thank the co-editors of the IFPRI blog series Jo Swinnen and John Mcdermott as well as Josh Felman and Harsh\nVardhan for useful comments and discussions. Some portions of the chapter have been published as separate articles in popular\nmedia and blogs as mentioned in the references section.\n3\nThe name of the virus is SARS-COV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) which causes the coronavirus disease\n2019 referred to as Covid-19. Accordingly in this chapter we use Covid-19 to refer to the disease.\n4\nSee: https://time.com/5818819/imf-coronavirus-economic-collapse/\n2\nIndia recorded the first case of the disease on January 30, 2020. Since then the cases have increased steadily\nand significantly. At the time of writing of this chapter (July 2nd week, 2020), and as shown in figure 1,\nIndia has recorded the third highest Covid-19 caseload in the world after the United States and Russia with\nmore than a million confirmed cases and more than 25,000 deaths .5\n The doubling rate has steadily gone up\nto around 18-22 days (figure 2) and the daily new confirmed cases are around 28,000-30,000.\nHowever, as shown in figure 1 the growth in active cases is lower than the growth in total cases implying a\nrelatively high recovery rate which has continued to improve. Also figure 3 shows that, unlike other affected\ncountries the number of daily new cases is yet to reach the peak in India. Globally there have been more than\n13million confirmed cases and close to 6 lakh deaths (World Health Organization).\nIn order to curb the spread of the virus, the government of India announced a nationwide lock-down starting\nMarch 25, 2020 which continued for about two months. All non-essential services and businesses, including\nretail establishments, educational institutions, places of religious worship, across the country stayed closed\nduring this period and all means of travel were stopped, aside from some inter-state transport permitted\ntowards end April and early May to let migrant workers, stranded pilgrims, tourists and students return to\ntheir native places At the time this was the most far-reaching measure undertaken by any government in\nresponse to the pandemic and till date remains the world’s biggest lock-down in context of this disease\nSubsequently from end May early June onward the lock-down was gradually relaxed in a phased manner\nbut continued in high-risk zones or ‘containment’ areas. This was required given the uneven spread of the\npandemic across the country with some states like Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal\netc reporting higher than average confirmed cases and also given the tremendous hardship that the\nnationwide lock-down had begun imposing on the overall economy. With the continued surge in cases, after\nan initial phase of relaxations in June, the nationwide lock-down was extended till July 31 albeit in a less\nstrict manner compared to the lock-down of March 24.\nMeasured relaxations have been permitted in areas outside the ‘containment or high-risk zones’ including\nopening of non-essential establishments, and businesses. Domestic flights have been allowed subject to the\nguidelines issued by the government to ensure safe travel of the passengers amidst the pandemic. However\nrestrictions on educational institutions, places of public gathering such as shopping malls, gymnasiums,\nswimming pools, cinema theatres, entertainment parks, places of religious worship, operation of metro train\nservices etc continue. While vehicular movement within states is allowed there remains in place a nightcurfew period in almost all states. The re-imposition of the lock-down has delayed any chance of economic\nrecovery that was anticipated once the first phase of ‘unlocking’ had begun in June.\nThe lock-down was primarily intended to buy time to prepare the health system and to put together a plan of\n\n5 Data on Indian cases are from https://www.covid19india.org/ and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. D\n3\nhow to deal with the outbreak once the case-load started accelerating. India's public health system is\nrelatively weaker than other countries. The government spends only 1.5% of the total GDP on public health\nas a result of which the system remains grossly under-prepared to deal with a health crisis such as this.6\nFigure 1: Confirmed Covid-19 cases in India\nTo the extent possible, the lock-down period was used to ramp up testing, contact-tracing, isolating\nconfirmed patients in designated quarantine centres and setting up treatment facilities including makeshift\nhospitals. However the health care system continues to be overwhelmed by the rising number of patients\nevery day especially in the worst affected states.\nFigure 2: Doubling rate of confirmed Covid-19 cases in India\nSource: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; Citibank Research. Doubling rate represents the number of days it would take for the\ncases to double if the daily percentage increase in confirmed cases remains unchanged.\nThe unprecedented lock-down has had a significant adverse effect on the economy. Millions of jobs and\nlivelihoods are now at stake. As activity around the country came to a halt, with no job or income, more than\n50 million migrant workers either returned to their native villages or shifted to camps inside the cities\nbecause state borders were sealed. While there are reports of some of them returning back to the cities now\nin search of jobs and livelihoods majority have not yet come back thereby imposing a massive strain on\n\n6\nEconomic Survey, 2019-20; https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/\n4\nlabour supply in the urban areas. Transportation of raw materials and finished goods across states was also\nseverely constrained. Countries have closed national borders bringing international trade and commerce to an\nabrupt halt. All these are severely disrupting supply mechanisms and distribution chains in almost all sectors.\nAt the same time, there has been a complete collapse of consumption demand as millions of people stay\nhome and postpone their non-essential expenditures.\nFigure 3: New daily confirmed cases across the world\nSourc\ne: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Citibank Research.\nThe overall magnitude of the impact of the pandemic will depend upon the duration and severity of the\nhealth crisis, the extent to which intermittent lock-downs are required in different regions of the country and\nthe manner in which the situation unfolds as and when the nationwide lock-down is finally lifted and normal\neconomic activity is permitted. The loss to the economy has already been substantial.\nThis crisis comes at a time when India's GDP growth was slowing down, and unemployment was on the rise\nowing to poor economic performance over the last several years. The precarious situation that the economy\nwas in before getting hit by this shock will potentially worsen the effect of the shock. This is especially\nbecause the financial sector which is the brain of the economy has not been functioning properly and the\nmacroeconomic policy space to respond to such a crisis is severely limited.\nEarlier, Indian economy was primarily experiencing a demand slowdown whereas now both demand and\nsupply have been disrupted. There are four channels through which the impact is getting transmitted to\noutput growth. These are: external supply and demand constraints due to global recession and disruption of\nglobal supply chains, domestic supply disruptions, and decline in domestic demand. The economic shock is\nimpacting both formal and informal sectors.\nIt may take a long time for the economy to recover from this shock even if the lock-down is fully lifted by\nAugust or September, 2020. To a large extent the recovery will depend on the policy responses of the \n5\ngovernment and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the crisis period. The policymakers have already\nannounced an initial round of actions. Much more needs to be done to minimize the impact of the shock on\nthe economy.\nIn this chapter we analyze the Indian economy in the pre Covid-19 period and assess the potential impact of\nthe shock on various segments of the economy. We discuss the policies that have been announced so far to\nameliorate the economic shock and finally end with some policy recommendations.\n2. Indian economy in pre-Covid-19 period\nThe shock is playing out in almost a similar manner in all countries of the world in terms of demand and\nsupply disruptions and the consequent economic slowdown. In case of India however the problem might be\nmore acute and longer lasting owing to the state the economy was in, in the pre-Covid-19 period. By the time\nthe first Covid-19 case was reported in India, the economy had deteriorated significantly after years of feeble\nperformance.\nGDP (gross domestic product) growth rate has been on a downward trajectory since 2015-16.\nAccording to the official statistics, GDP growth slowed down to 4.2% in 2019-20, the lowest level since\n2002-03. Industry, which accounts for 30% of GDP, shrank by 0.58% in Q4, 2019-20. Unemployment\nreached a 45-year high. A major driver of growth in any economy is investment by the private corporate\nsector. In the pre-Covid19 period, nominal values of private sector investment have been declining. The total\noutstanding investment projects between 2015-16 and 2019-20 declined by 2.4%, whereas new projects\nannounced fell by 4%, as per data from the CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy). Consumption\nexpenditure had also been falling, for the first time in several decades.\nHigh frequency indicators (figure 4) of urban consumption demand show that sales of passenger vehicles as\nwell as consumer durables growth contracted in February 2020. Overall, urban consumption appears to have\nlost steam in Q4. Among the indicators of rural consumption, motorcycle sales and the consumer nondurable segment remained in contraction in February 2020, reflecting weak rural demand. The lock-down\nwould have dampened any chance of revival of consumption demand and private investment. \n6\nFigure 4: High frequency indicators: Consumption demand\nSource: RBI (2020)\nA few specific factors make India's position particularly vulnerable as it tries to deal with the ongoing\neconomic crisis.\n2.1 Informal sector\nIndia has a vast informal sector, the largest in the world, employing close to 90% of its working population\nand contributing more than 45% to its overall GDP. This sector was hit by two consecutive shocks in a short\nspan of time, from 2016 to 2019. The first shock was Demonetisation in November 2016 when 86% of the\nmoney in the economy became unusable overnight owing to a government decree, followed by the\nhaphazard introduction of the Goods and Services tax in 2017.7\nWhile demonetisation was a big enough monetary shock, it did not fundamentally disrupt demand and\nsupply mechanisms for too long. There was a temporary lack of means of payment.8 We now know in\nhindsight that people found work-arounds in the forms of electronic payments, informal credit, converting\nblack money into white, using old notes etc. In the case of the current crisis, the demand is not there, the\nsupply is not there, and hence the underlying revenues are not there. This is therefore much more\nproblematic. With the Covid-19 outbreak, the already struggling informal sector has been disproportionately\naffected (Ray and Subramanian, 2020).\n2.2 The banking and corporate sectors\nDuring crisis times, one sector of the economy that is required to play a crucial role in terms of alleviating\nthe pressures on the real economy is the financial sector. The need of the hour is to keep credit flowing to all\n\n7\nSee: https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/macroeconomics/reviving-the-informal-sector-from-the-throes-of-demonetisation.html\n8\nSee: https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/macroeconomics/a-macro-view-of-india-s-currency-ban.html and\nideasforindia.in/topics/money-finance/a-monetary-economics-view-of-the-demonetisation.html\n7\ncategories of economic agents- firms, households etc., to help them tide over this crisis.\nIn a bank dominated economy, particularly at a time when the stock market is touching new lows every day,\nthe financial intermediaries that most firms will turn to are the banks. Actions taken by banks would be\ncrucial in addressing this economic challenge. Banks also play a vital role as institutional participants in the\ndebt market.\nHowever, the banking sector in India is badly broken. Banks, especially the public sector banks, have been\nstruggling to deal with mounting losses from non-performing assets on their balance sheets. The problems in\nthe banking sector have been adversely affecting credit growth and by the time the pandemic hit India,\nthese problems had begun to hurt the debt markets as well which also play an important role in the context of\nfinancial intermediation. This could rapidly become a serious choke point as the Indian economy struggles to\ncome to terms with this unprecedented shock.\nOver the last few years, India has been dealing with the Twin Balance Sheet (TBS) stresses in the banking\nand corporate sectors. This was a consequence of high levels of non-performing assets (NPAs) in an\ninadequately capitalised banking system, combined with over-leveraged and financially weak firms in the\nprivate corporate sector (Sengupta and Vardhan, 2017, 2019).\nThe government and the banking regulator (RBI) took a series of steps to address the crisis. These included\nputting the weakest ten banks under a Prompt Corrective Action framework which prevented them from\nexpanding their books, initiating investigations by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), Central Bureau\nof Investigation (CBI) etc. against senior officials of the banks, and directing banks to trigger the Insolvency\nand Bankruptcy Code (IBC, 2016) against defaulting firms and accept large haircuts even when capital to\nprovide for the losses was not sufficient.\nIn some cases senior officials of banks were arrested for allegedly fraudulent credit transactions.9\nIn February\n2016, the Supreme Court issued a ruling which held that employees of all banking companies, foreign as\nwell as domestic, are “public servants” under India's Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (“POCA”). This\nimplies that all bank employees now face the risk of investigation and prosecution under the POCA for\nissues related to corruption. Nearly any decision about NPAs could come under the scanner. This single step\nis likely to deter bank officers from taking commercial decisions. This is particularly worrisome, given the\nexpansive description of corruption under POCA and minimal restrictions on investigations, as highlighted\nby commentators at the time.\n10 These measures arguably led to a rise in the risk aversion in the banking\nsystem (Sengupta and Vardhan, 2020b).\nAs the NPA crisis began plateauing out, the financial system faced another blow when a large non-banking\n\n9\nSee https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/cbi-arrests-former-idbi-chairman-yogesh-aggarwal-and-8-\nothers-in-vijay-mallya-loan-default-case-sources/articleshow/56740233.cms?from=mdr\n10See https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/aHPk4JfpTEpmefmKIlizQK/The-benefit-of-the-doubt.html\n8\nfinance company (NBFC), IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Service) defaulted on its debts in\nSeptember, 2018. This sent shockwaves through the banking system as well as the debt markets- the two\nbiggest funding sources for the NBFC sector. The reaction of the bond markets was reflected in a sharp\nincrease in credit spreads of all financial sector bond issuers. The total volume of bond issuances dropped\nsignificantly, not just for financial sector firms but for all borrowers. Banks continued lending, primarily\nencouraged by the RBI and the government, but this lending was limited to a handful of highly rated NBFCs.\nThe IL&FS episode further worsened the risk appetite of the banks and triggered risk aversion in the debt\nmarkets as well.\nOne direct consequence of the heightened risk aversion in the banking system has been the lack of growth in\ncommercial credit supply. Banks, especially the public sector banks (PSBs) which account for close to 90%\nof the NPAs, severely cut back lending to the private corporate sector. By FY2017, net bank credit was\ngrowing at a decade's low of 2.69% per year. By FY2018, PSBs were lending mostly to NBFCs, and private\nsector banks were mainly lending to retail customers. Credit to industry had declined dramatically whereas\ncredit off-take in personal loans segment accounted for the largest share (figure 6).\nPost the IL&FS crisis credit spreads on corporate debt securities remained elevated and overall bank lending,\nafter an initial spurt in the last quarter of FY2019 (mostly lending to NBFCs), tapered off. Commercial credit\nwitnessed a sharp decline of almost 90% in the first half of FY2020. In the months of February and March,\n2020, the near-demise of Yes bank, a large private sector bank, triggered the risk of deposit squeeze for\nprivate sector banks which would further curtail credit growth.11 As a result, credit off-take during 2019-20\n(up to March 13, 2020) was muted with non-food credit growth at 6.1% being less than half the growth of\n14.4% in the corresponding period of the previous year (figure 5). This was also the lowest growth rate of\nnon-food bank credit in nearly six decades.\nFigure 5: YoY Credit and deposit growth of the banking sector\n Source: ICRA report. This shows total non-food credit growth.\n\n11See: https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/rbi-imposes-moratorium-on-yes-bank-caps-withdrawals-at-rs-50-000-sources11583421982753.html and https://theprint.in/economy/dont-withdraw-funds-from-private-banks-itll-hurt-financial-stability-rbi-tellsstates/380055/\n9\nFigure 6: Sectoral deployment of credit\nSource: RBI (2020)\nWhile part of the fall in commercial credit growth may have been due to lack of demand given the balance\nsheet crisis in the private corporate sector, anecdotal evidence suggests that reluctance in banks to extend\ncredit has also been a big factor.12 As admitted by the RBI Governor himself in recent times (italics and\nhighlight added): “In view of subdued profitability and deleveraging by certain corporates, risk-averse\nbanks have shifted their focus away from large infrastructure and industrial loans towards retail loans.”13\nThe consequences of heightened risk aversion in the banking system have begun hurting the debt markets. In\na situation where bank credit growth has been at a multi-decade low, debt market especially the short term\ndebt market plays a vital role in financing firms. As shown in figures 7a and 7b, banks’ holding of non-SLR\nbonds has declined sharply which means they are averse to credit risk. Banks are instead holding more GSecs than the SLR requirements and the excess SLR of all banks – PSBs, private, and foreign has gone up\nsharply which means the credit risk aversion is across the board.\n\n12See: https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/credit-growth-to-industry-farm-sector-falls-despite-rbi-rate-cuts-6294701/\n13See: https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/credit-growth-to-industry-farm-sector-falls-despite-rbi-rate-cuts-6294701/\n10\nFigure 7a: Non-SLR investment and adjusted non-food credit\nSource: RBI (2020)\nFigure 7b: Excess SLR of banks\nSource: RBI (2020)\nJust as the debt market was beginning to regain its appetite for corporate debt securities in the aftermath of\nthe NBFC crisis of 2018-19, it was hit by the Yes Bank episode. As part of the restructuring of Yes Bank, its\nadditional tier 1 (AT1) bonds were written down completely.\n14 These AT1 bonds are an important\ncomponent of capital for banks. Roughly Rs 89,000 crore worth of bonds were outstanding in the banking\nsystem as a whole, at the time of this write down. These were widely held by mutual funds, pension funds\nand even retail investors.\nCredit spreads on all these AT1 bonds shot up and several planned issuances were cancelled. It is unlikely\n\n14 AT1, short for Additional Tier-1 bonds, are a type of unsecured, perpetual bonds that banks issue to shore up their core\ncapital base to meet the Basel-III norms. See: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rbi-releases-yes-bankrescue-plan-sbi-can-pick-49-stake-at-minimum-rs-10-per-share/articleshow/74513250.cms and\nhttps://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/money-finance/the-anatomy-of-a-crisis.html\n11\nthat any bank will be able to issue these bonds in the near future making it difficult for banks, especially\nprivate sector banks to raise capital. This is going to become a serious constraint as banks struggle to deal\nwith the impact of the Covid-19 shock on their already fragile balance sheets.\nThe private corporate sector had already been facing significant balance sheet stress over the last few years.\nTheir financial performance in 2019-20 was exceptionally poor. The first three quarters of the year saw\ninflation-adjusted sales decline in year-on-year comparisons. All the quarters also saw a similar decline in\ninflation-adjusted gross value added by companies. Private sector investment has been declining. Gross fixed\ncapital formation (GFCF) growth turned negative in Q2 and Q3, 2019-20. Two key indicators of investment\ndemand, production and imports of capital goods remained in contraction in January and February 2020\n(RBI, 2020). Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector declined below the long-term average in Q3,\n2019-20.\n2.3 Limited policy space\nGiven the state of the economy and especially the state of the financial institutions, the policy levers\navailable to the government to deal with the economic crisis are limited. When the effects of 2008 Global\nFinancial Crisis (GFC) were felt in India, the domestic economy was in a better shape having experienced a\ncredit boom and a high growth rate for the preceding years and the government was also in a position to\nimplement both monetary and fiscal stimulus measures. More importantly, the financial institutions were not\nso badly damaged.\nIn contrast, the fiscal deficit of the government was already high in the pre-Covid-19 period and had\nbreached the target as specified in the FRBM Act (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act). The\nfiscal deficit of the central government in 2019-20 was 4.6% of GDP against the target of 3.5% of GDP. This\nhas been the highest fiscal deficit since 2012-13. The Finance Minister in her Budget Speech of February 1,\n2020 had pegged the target for FY2021 to 3.5% (table 1) which will be breached by a wide margin. The FM\nhad already used the escape clause provided under the FRBM Act to allow the relaxation of target for 2019-\n20. The clause allows the government to relax the fiscal deficit target for up to 50 basis points or 0.5%.\nThis shows that the government now has very little fiscal room. As the crisis unfolds, falling tax collections,\ndeclining revenues of public sector enterprises and rise in health sector expenses will further hamper the\nability of the government to support the economy. Even without any additional expenditure, the deficit\nwould go up substantially because of the decline in tax revenues and disinvestment receipts. Net tax revenues\nin April 2020 fell by a staggering 70% compared to April 2019. If state-level deficits are added, then the\noverall fiscal deficit in 2020-21 could very well exceed 10% of GDP, even without taking into account the\noff-balance sheet items. Financing such high levels of deficit poses a serious challenge. \n12\nTable 1: Key Fiscal Indicators – Central Government Finances\nSource: RBI (2020)\nMonetary policy has its limitations too which had become apparent in the run-up to this crisis. In response to\nthe growth slowdown, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) embarked on a path of monetary expansion. Between\nOctober 2018 and December 2019, it freed up around Rs. 4 trillion of liquidity through open market\noperations15, and reduced the repo rate16 by 135 basis points to 5.15% – the lowest since March 2010. Yet,\ncredit growth did not pick up, primarily due to the heightened risk aversion in the banking sector, as\ndiscussed earlier, and low credit demand from the stressed private corporate sector.\nMonetary policy transmission in India has been weak owing to structural deficiencies such as illiquid bond\nmarket, large sections of the population left out of the formal financial system etc. In addition, an impaired\nbanking system and lacklustre investment demand from the private corporate sector, will further hamper the\ntransmission of a policy rate cut to aggregate demand and hence growth.\nIn other words, the combination of demand and supply shocks are hitting the Indian economy at a time when\nthe tools to deal with the crisis are mostly ineffective, namely fiscal, monetary and financial. Over and above\nthis, the external sector of the economy has been weakening as well. The nominal value of exports of goods\nand services – another important driver of growth – witnessed a decline by 8.49% in Q4, 2019-20.\n3. Impact of the crisis\n3.1 Overall macro impact\nThe countrywide lockdown has brought nearly all economic activities to an abrupt halt. The disruption of\n\n15 RBI conducts monetary policy through open market operations (OMO) – purchase (or sale) securities to infuse (or\nabsorb) liquidity. OMO though essentially a monetary tool, has to factor in the large market borrowing at times to\nmaintain orderly financial conditions.\n16 The rate at which RBI lends money to commercial banks.\n13\ndemand and supply forces are likely to continue even after the lockdown is lifted. It will take time for the\neconomy to return to a normal state and even then social distancing measures will continue for as long as the\nhealth shock plays out. Hence demand is unlikely to get restored in the next several months, especially\ndemand for non-essential goods and services. Three major components of aggregate demand- consumption,\ninvestment, and exports are likely to stay subdued for a prolonged period of time.\nIn addition to the unprecedented collapse in demand, widespread supply chain disruptions will continue for\na while due to the unavailability of raw materials, exodus of millions of migrant workers from urban areas,\nslowing global trade, and shipment and travel related restrictions imposed by nearly all affected countries.\nThe supply chains are unlikely to normalise for some time to come. Already several industries are struggling\nowing to complete disruption of supply chains from China. The longer the crisis lasts, the more difficult it\nwill be for firms to stay afloat. This will negatively affect production in almost all domestic industries. This\nin turn will have further spill over effects on investment, employment, income and consumption, pulling\ndown the aggregate growth rate of the economy.\nAt this stage, the possible duration of the underlying health crisis remains uncertain. In addition there are\nmultiple unknown factors such as the true extent of impairment suffered by the different sectors of the\neconomy, the magnitude of deterioration of the balance sheets of economic agents such as firms and\nhouseholds, the ability of both the formal and informal sectors to bounce back to normalcy once the\nlockdown is fully relaxed and most importantly, the potential destruction of the productive capacity of the\neconomy. Therefore, it is difficult to fully comprehend the extent of the damage that the Indian economy is\ncurrently incurring. Some of the statistics available now already highlight the severity and duration of the\nslowdown the economy may experience going forward. After some amount of recovery in economic activity\nin June, 2020 it appears that the slowdown has resumed once again in most of the sectors. The improvement\nseen in most high-frequency indicators in June after the dramatic collapse in the April-May period has begun\nto wane since mid June. This is presumably due to the renewed lockdowns all over the country and damage\nto consumer sentiment and overall economic productivity.\nFigure 8: All India electricity demand (YoY)\nElect\n14\nricity demand declined to 30% below last year’s levels (figure 8) and gradually recovered thereafter. Since\nJune end there has been no further moderation in the pace of deceleration in electricity demand.

Introduction\n\nCOVID-19 is a global health problem including Indonesia. This was initiated from\nthe information of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019 there was\na case of a cluster of pneumonia with a new etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,\nChina and later expanded beyond China. On 30 January 2020, COVID-19 was set to\nbecome the public health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 11 March\n2020, COVID-19 was designated as a pandemic. Indonesia first reported 2 positive cases\non March 2, 2020 and a positive case continued to increase (Kementrian Kesehatan RI,\n2020a). Until April 25, 2020, Indonesia already reported 8. 211 Positive cases, 689 cases\ndied, 1.002 cases recovered from 50,563 people examined with the results of the\nexamination is 42,352 negative (Kementrian Kesehatan RI, 2020b).\nAbstract\nCOVID-19 is a global health problem including in Indonesia.\nThe increased case of COVID-19 proved to have quite a\nsignificant impact on the economy globally which may have\naffected stability in Indonesia. This method of collecting data is a\nmethod of study literature with secondary data types. Data is\ntaken from the Internet with respect to the validity of information\nsuch as government official information, official online sites and\nprocessed results of valid data. After obtaining the existing\nreference, a sorting of information that is appropriate to the topic\nof discussion. Data analysis is presented in graphical form and\ncomes with a descriptive narrative. Based on the research, the\nimpact of COVID-19 pandemic affects the economy in Indonesia.\nThe affected sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic are\ntransportation, tourism, trade, health and other sectors, but the\neconomic sector most affected by COVID-19 is the household\nsector. Optimizing the potential in the country, the decline of BI-7\nDay Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR), the interest rate of Deposit\nfacility, and Lending facility interest rate, monitoring of global\nand domestic economic development conducted by Indonesia was\nassessed precisely so that inflation and stability remain in\ncontrol.\n\nKeywords\nimpact; pandemic; Covid-19;\neconomy; Indonesia\n\nBudapest International Research and Critics Institute-Journal (BIRCI-Journal)\nVolume 3, No 2, May 2020, Page: 1147-1156\ne-ISSN: 2615-3076(Online), p-ISSN: 2615-1715(Print)\nwww.bircu-journal.com/index.php/birci\nemails: birci.journal@gmail.com\n\n1148\n\nFigure 1. Trend Case Confirmation in Indonesia\n\nThe increased case of COVID-19 has affected the world economy including Indonesia.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that has been established by the UN, affects the transportation,\ntourism, trade, health and other sectors. The \"lock down\" policy is taken by various countries\nto prevent further spread of covid-19, so that economic activities are hindered and put\npressure on the world's economic growth in the future including Indonesia's economic\ngrowth. The Government encourages the Ministry and institutions (K/L) as well as the local\ngovernment (PEMDA) to accelerate spending primarily on the first quarter 2020 schedule.\nThis was done to reduce the pressure on Indonesia's economic growth due to the pandemic\nCovid-19, as well as a decline in commodity prices (Kementerian Keuangan RI, 2020a).\nThe World Bank is projecting Indonesia's economic growth this year will be depressed\nat 2.1 percent. This is due to the continued widespread distribution of Covid-19 both\ndomestically and abroad. Bank Indonesia (BI) has also revised the projected economic\ngrowth of the RI to under 5 percent or only about 2.5 percent. Pandemic Covid-19 will have a\nbad implication for the world's economy and Indonesia this year, as it occurs along with\ndeclining commodity prices and financial market volatility. The relationship between\ninflation and economic growth is one of the debatable issue and the most important\nmacroeconomic discussions among macro economists, policy-makers and monetary\nauthorities in all countries (Wollie, 2018). Inflation that occurred in this year in the projection\nwill be increased to 3 percent, because of the tight supply of food and depreciation of\ncurrencies that are expected to be offset partly by the decline in the price of non-subsidized\nfuels, as well as additional subsidies for electricity and food. However, in the year 2021\ninflation is believed to return to normal levels, which is 2.8 percent. Which is usually able to\ngrow to 5.02 percent. Meanwhile, in terms of inflation, tourism and commodity export\nrevenues, there is an estimated decline that resulted in the current transaction deficit reaching\n2.9 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 (Kementerian Keuangan RI, 2020a).\nAccording to A. Ademuyiwa (2019) when an economy is going through a persistent inflation,\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) increases, this does not actually reflect the true growth in an\neconomy. Hence, the rate of inflation must be subtracted from the GDP to get the real growth\npercentage, called the real GDP.\n\n1149\n\nFigure 2. COVID-19 Spread in Indonesia\n\nThe government also conducts re-focusing budgeting and launches fiscal Stimulus\nPackages Vol I and vol II which are expected to support the real sector. In general, the\ncurrent government's top priorities are support for the healthcare sector, strengthening social\nsafety nets and salvage business sectors (Kementerian Keuangan RI, 2020a). However, for\nIndonesia, COVID-19 already has significant implications for the tourism sector, lowering\nexport performance, economic growth performance. The most impactful main sectors are the\naccommodation sector, transportation, retail, and manufacturing of the current transaction\nbalance deficit (CAD) (Media Indonesia, 2020).\nIf it is reviewed from the workers ' economy, it is based on the UN's Department of\nEconomic and Social Affairs (UN-village), that millions of workers are at risk of losing jobs\nwhen nearly 100 countries close the national frontier in terms of a global economic\ncontraction of 0.9 percent or higher at the end of 2020 (Surabaya Net, 2020). Therefore, the\nresearch aims to see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the economy in Indonesia.\n\nII. Research Methods\n\n2.1 Information Collection\nThis method of collecting the research data uses the literature study method. The type\nof data collected is secondary data. Data extracted from online Media with data criteria are\ntaken from official website Information of the Government of Indonesia, website official\nonline news website, and processed data from relevant sources. The criteria of data that is not\ntaken are personal website Information (blog), personal quotes of people (non-government),\nsocial media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other social media), and media chat. The\nrange of information updates starts from February 2020 to May 2020. The Data collected\ncomes from publications in Indonesia (online).\n2.2 Place and Time Research\nThis research place is conducted in Medan City, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia.\nWhile the research time began in February 2020 until the month of May 2020.\n2.3 Information Processing\nAfter obtaining an existing reference, the sorting of information that corresponds to the\ntopic of discussion is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the economy in Indonesia,\nand then the processing of information according to the topic of discussion.\n\n1150\n\n2.4 Information Analysis\nBased on the literature study conducted, data analysis presented in the form of graphs\nand equipped with a descriptive narrative related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to\nthe economy in Indonesia.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nBased on Manulife investment Management data, Indonesia is a country that has\ndecreased interest rates, decreased major sectors such as tourism sector, aviation\ntransportation, property, and social security as well as a GWM (mandatory Giro) decline\n(Manulife Investment Management, 2020).\n\nFigure 3. Fiscal and Monetary Policy Response – ASIA\n\nPandemic COVID-19 in Indonesia resulted in a potentially growing negative\nIndonesian economy of 0.4% which is the worst-case scenario. The optimal scenario is only\n2.3%. Reviewed from the growth of household consumption, growth scenarios were assessed\nto slow down, which was 3.2% in weight scenarios, and 1.6% in worst-case scenarios, and\ngovernment consumption growth only grew 6.83 % or worst case scenario of 3.73% (Kata\nData, 2020b).\n\nFigure 4. PSBB Distribution in Indonesia\n\n1151\n\nIn areas that implement large-scale social restrictions (PSBB), it certainly has an impact\non the economy. One of the areas that implement PSBB, namely Jakarta, is the calculation of\nthe scenario so that the results gained that economic activity does not stop completely. About\n75% stopped for 14 days in the worst scenario, thus having an implication of -2.78% against\ngross Regional domestic product (PDRB), and a decrease in household income of -2.77%\n(CNBC, 2020).\nIf reviewed from employment, it will impact on 1% termination of employment based\non sector, trade, hotel, and restaurant, Transportation and communication, services, industry,\nelectricity, gas, clean water and excavation and mining sectors. The result of termination of\nthe relationship is predicted to affect -0.8% economic growth (CNBC, 2020).\n\nFigure 5. Growth Scenarios\n\nOn the consumption aspect of non-profit institutions that serve households, will\ndecrease by 1.78% or worst-case scenario 1.91%. The cause of the decline is a less positive\ninvestment (1% growth) or an estimate of the largest decline of 4%, export sector which\ndecreased 14% to 15.6%, and imports that dropped 14.5% to 16.65% (Kata Data, 2020b).\n\nFigure 6. Cause of Decline\n\n1152\n\nBased on sectors that have impacted the impact of pandemic Covid-19, the household\nsector has been a very significant sector because it does not conduct economic activity, Small\nand Medium Enterprises (UMKM) and corporations become a sector affected and implication\nin the financial sector (Kata Data, 2020b).\nIn general, the impact of COVID-19 is quite significant to the Indonesian economy.\nThe global economic throttling and manufacturing industry performance will have an impact\non export performance in Indonesia. The decline in economic productivity (20 to 25 percent),\nwhich led to China's 5 percent economic growth, led to various conditions (CSIS Indonesia,\n2020).\n\nTable 1. Percentage of imports Indonesia from China 2018\n\nTypes of Goods/Products Percentage (%)\nCapital goods 39.33\nSemi-Finished goods 23.14\nMachine Parts and Components 36.27\n• Parts and components of office equipment and communication\ndevices\n\n29.05\n• Parts and components of motor vehicles 17.48\nSource: CSIS Indonesia\nSource of raw materials or capital goods, of course, Indonesia need to find such sources\nfrom other countries even more expensive price. Optimizing the domestic potential is\nimportant to be done as a result of China's economic slowdown and is expected to be an\nalternative production center so as to contribute to global supply during COVID-19\npandemic. Indonesia steps such as the decline of BI-7 Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR),\ninterest rate Deposit Facility, and Lending facility interest rate, monitoring of global and\ndomestic economic development conducted by Indonesia are assessed precisely so that\ninflation and stability remain in control.\nIndonesian Ministry of Finance noted at least eight losses caused by the outbreak of the\nvirus. First, until 11 April more than 1.5 million employees broke down or termination of\nemployment (LAYOFFS) and was formulated. Where 1.2 million workers came from the\nformal sector, 265,000 from the informal sector. Secondly, the Indonesian Purchasing\nManagers Index (PMI) below the 50 level is only 45.3 in March 2020. Thirdly, more than\n12,703 flights at 15 airports were cancelled throughout January-February, with details of\n11,680 domestic flights and 1,023 international flights. Fourth, around Rp 207 billion lost\nrevenues in the air service sector, with approximately Rp 48 billion lost donated by China's\nflights. Fifth, tourist numbers decreased to 6,800 per day, especially tourists from China.\nSixth, Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association estimates that declining occupancy rates\naround 6,000 hotels in Indonesia can reach 50%. This could affect the decline of tourism\nforeign exchange more than half a year ago. Seventh, Indonesia's imports throughout\nJanuary-March 2020 dropped 3.7% year to date (YTD). Eighth, inflation in March 2020\nrecorded at 2.96% year on year (yoy) was donated by gold price increases in jewelry as well\nas some food prices soaring. However, there are deflation on various chili commodities and\nair freight rates (Santoso, 2020).\n\n1153\n\nTable 2.

This resulted in the tourism sector being paralyzed,\nso that unemployment is increasing because tourism is one of the containers that provide jobs\nfor the community around the tourism area and outside society. It is not only a temporary\nparalysis of the tourism sector, but employees of other types of companies have experienced\nthe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. worker activity that is usually done outside the home\ndirectly forced to be done in the House, and there are many employees who are threatened by\nthe termination of work rights (layoffs) because of the many jobs that are not possible to be\ndone at home, as does the production activities that depend on the machine that is in the\nproduction place. The termination of this work is also done due to lack of purchase from\nconsumers and dibatasinya exports to certain countries so that it will inhibit exports and\nreduce the company's revenue, even the company can suffer losses. There is also another\ncause of dismissing the employees because of the scarcity of raw materials to be produced\nimported from the outside country such as from China so that it will impede industrial\nactivities. Companies that cease to operate and an increase in the number of unemployment\nrates can inhibit and reduce gross domestic product (GDP) and inhibit Indonesia's economic\ngrowth despite the policy being done, but there are still people who misuse this policy, such\nas learning activities and work at home in use for vacations outside the city. Thus, this policy\ncan expand and accelerate the spread of Corona viruses, both from being disseminated by\nvisitors to local communities, as well as disseminated by local communities to visitors.\nCorona virus outbreak in China was also suspected to have an impact on Indonesian\nagricultural trade. During this time the export of palm oil is one of the largest export\ncontributors to China. However, in February 2020, the realization only reached 84,000\ntonnes. This figure is very far when compared with the previous month's realization of\nJanuary 2020 of 487,000 tons and in the same period of 2019 that reached 371,000 tons\n(Detik.com, 2020).\nIn terms of the import of food, Indonesia, which has a dependence of garlic from China,\ncan only import garlic from China for 23,000 tonnes by February 2020. This figure also drops\ndrastically when compared with the previous year's imports reaching 583,000 tons\n(finance.detik.com, 17 February 2020). In February 2020, China's largest import decline was\nalso seen on fruit commodities. The fruit commodity imports fell significantly by 78.88%\nfrom USD160,4 million to USD33,9 million (Kata Data, 2020a).\nSince the outbreak of the Corona virus, in addition to enforcing the restriction policies\nof importing living animals from China, the government also stopped flights from and to\nChina as of February 5, 2020. Which of course will also affect the Indonesian tourism sector.\n\n1154\n\nMany travel and flight companies suffer losses due to flight termination from and to China.\nSince the implementation, the number of Chinese tourists visit to Bali has decreased. In 2019,\nfrom 6.3 million foreign tourists, as many as 1,185,519 tourists or 18.2% were from China.\nHowever in January to mid-February 2020 noted 22,000 Chinese tourists cancel to Bali\n(Tribunnews, 2020). It greatly affects the economy of Bali province.\nIn February 2020, state acceptance showed an improvement from January 2020.\nRealization of state income and grants per end of February 2020 has reached Rp216,61\ntrillion or 9.70 percent of the target on the BUDGET 2020. The realization is supported by\nthe tax receipt recorded as positive growth, which is growing by 0.3 percent. With such\nconditions, until the end of February 2020 the realization of taxation receipt recorded at\nRp177,96 trillion or has reached 9.54 percent of the target stipulated in the state BUDGET,\nnon-tax country acceptance (PNBP) reached Rp38,62 trillion (10.52 percent of the target),\nand grants amounting to RP0,03 trillion (5.73 percent of the target) (Kementerian Keuangan\nRI, 2020a).\nThe growth of tax revenues was driven by the growth of Earth and building tax\nrevenues (PBB) and other taxes, each growing 95.00 percent (YoY) and 5.67 percent (YoY).\nFor Nonmigas PPh, the achievement of its acceptance is still supported by the acceptance of\nPPh 21 which grew by 10.08 percent, PPh 25/29 agency, and PPh Final. The realization of\ncustoms and excise receipts reached 11.22 percent of the target in the BUDGET of 2020 and\nwas able to grow 51.52 percent (YoY). The actual realization of the acceptance is supported\nby the acceptance of excise and import duty (BM). The growth in its customs and excise\nacceptance is still derived from the recorded tax revenues of 89.20 percent (YoY)\n(Kementerian Keuangan RI, 2020a).\nThe realization of PNBP until the end of February 2020 reached Rp38,62 trillion or\n10.52 percent of the target in the BUDGET 2020. The achievement of PNBP realization is\nmainly dominated by the realization of PNBP SDA and other PNBP, each amounting to RP\nRp20,92 trillion and Rp15,98 trillion. The realization of the PNBP of SDA Migas (Natural\nresources of oil and Gas) Indonesian Crude Price (ICP) period from January to February 2020\nrecorded at USD61,00/barrel or higher USD2,07/barrel compared to the same period in the\nprevious year of USD58,93/barrel(Kementerian Keuangan RI, 2020a).\nGovernment Roles\nThe Indonesian Government has taken various measures through the social safety nets\nto help the people's economy affected by the COVID-19 either directly or indirectly. The step\nto break the COVID-19 deployment chain was judged to have an economic impact on the\ncrowd. This means that the Government is seriously providing an economic stimulus\npackage. The Government realized the true non-medical impact of the plague caused by the\nSARS-CoV-2 virus and can be seen from the many people who lost their jobs and livelihoods\nbecause they had to be home. Seeing the condition, the Government has made various efforts\nto help the Community economy through various policies. Policies that only rely on\neconomic growth are policies that limit the circulation of assets among the rich people\n(Martinelli, 2019). Some of these policies include direct cash assistance (BLT) which uses\nthe village fund. The BLT is budgeted to use a Rp22,47 trillion that is appropriated from the\nRP72 trillion estimated for the village fund. In addition, there is a “Prakerja’s card” with a\nmonthly incentive that reaches RP3, 5 million per person. Not only that the government has\nalso launched an electricity tariff reduction of 50 percent for customers capacity of 450 watts\nover three months (Arifin, 2020).\nSome of the steps to be taken are as follows: accelerating realization of Shopping\nministries/institutions, especially social assistance spending (SUCH as PKH and health), as\n\n1155\n\nwell as non-operational shopping, Mendorong tourism centers through various support\nprograms, such as the acceleration of development of five super-priority tourist destinations\n\n(Lake Toba, Borobudur, Likupang, Labuan The government will also set up fiscal and non-\nfiscal policies to stimulate the tourism sector, encourage and accelerating the labor-intensive\n\nspending on productive activities that absorb a lot of manpower, such as infrastructure\nshopping in the center and the region, are optimizing the role of the APBN as a flexible\ninstrument in response to the economic situation (countercyclical) by staying within the limits\nof safe and restrained, accelerating development of the people's Business Credit (KUR)\n(Kementerian Keuangan RI, 2020b).\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in addition to being a global health problem, also has\nimplications on the economy in Indonesia. Indonesia potentially grows negative 0.4% which\nis the worst-case scenario. The economic sector most affected by COVID-19 is the household\nsector. Optimizing the potential in the country, the decline of BI-7 Day Reverse Repo Rate\n(BI7DRR), the interest rate of Deposit facility, and Lending facility interest rate, monitoring\nof global and domestic economic development conducted by Indonesia was assessed\nprecisely so that inflation and stability remain in control.",

Dobson and Giorgio Parisi)\nThe spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy\nprompted drastic measures for transmission containment. We\nexamine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of\nthe unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially\nexplicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from\nthe initial foci to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a\nmetacommunity Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered (SEIR)-\nlike transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces\nconnected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We\nestimate a generalized reproduction number (R0 = 3.60 [3.49 to\n3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix\nthat measures the potential spread in the absence of containment\ninterventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21,\n2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in\nepidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities.\nWe draw scenarios of different containment measures and their\nimpact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to\nmobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the\nimposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of\nMarch 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to be\nreexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in\nthe distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of\nemergency measures.\nSARS-CoV-2 | spatially explicit epidemiology | disease outbreak\nscenarios | SEIR models | social contact restrictions\nS\nince December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases in the\ncity of Wuhan, China (1–7), has developed into a pandemic\nwave currently ravaging several countries (8–12). The pathogen\ncausing the acute pneumonia among affected individuals is the\nnew coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n2 (SARS-CoV-2) (8, 9, 13, 14). As of March 25, 2020, a total\nof 467, 593 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have\nbeen confirmed worldwide in 181 countries (15). In Italy, a\nhotspot of the pandemic, the count, as of March 25, 2020,\nrefers to 74, 386 total confirmed cases and 7, 503 deaths (15–\n18) (Figs. 1 and 2). The well-monitored progress of the wave of\ninfections highlighted in Fig. 1 (for complete documentation, see\nSI Appendix and Movies S1 and S2) clearly speaks of decisive\nspatial effects. Models are often used to infer key processes or\nevaluate strategies for mitigating influenza/SARS pandemics (5,\n6, 12, 19–24). Early attempts to model the spread of COVID19 in Italy (25, 26) aired concern regarding the Italian national\nhealth system’s capacity to respond to the needs of patients (27),\neven considering aggregate isolation measures. However, modeling predictions therein disregard the observed spatial nature of\nthe progress of the wave of infections, and can treat only indirectly the effects of containment measures. Critically, therefore,\nto deal with what could happen next in terms of forthcoming policy decisions, one needs to deal with spatially explicit\nmodels (12, 28, 29).\nWe model in space and time the countrywide spread of the\nCOVID-19 epidemic in Italy (Materials and Methods), for which\ndetailed epidemiological data are continuously updated and\nmade public (16, 18, 30). Data are only a proxy of the actual\nepidemiological conditions because 1) the number of infected\npeople on record depends on the sampling effort, namely, the\nnumber of specimen collections (swabs) from persons under\ninvestigation (PUIs) (implications discussed in Materials and\nMethods, and SI Appendix); and 2) the effects of systematic errors\nor bias in the official data result mainly in underreporting and\nneed to be considered. In fact, underreporting may apply even\nto fatality counts, yet to a lesser extent with respect to reported\ninfections. Hospitalizations are known, but may underestimate\nthe actual situation because cases with mild symptoms (termed\nSignificance\nThe ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 challenges globalized\nsocieties. Scientific and technological cross-fertilization yields\nbroad availability of georeferenced epidemiological data and\nof modeling tools that aid decisions on emergency management. To this end, spatially explicit models of the COVID-19\nepidemic that include e.g. regional individual mobilities, the\nprogression of social distancing, and local capacity of medical\ninfrastructure provide significant information. Data-tailored\nspatial resolutions that model the disease spread geography\ncan include details of interventions at the proper geographical scale. Based on them, it is possible to quantify the\neffect of local containment measures (like diachronic spatial\nmaps of averted hospitalizations) and the assessment of the\nspatial and temporal planning of the needs of emergency\nmeasures and medical infrastructure as a major contingency\nplanning aid.\nAuthor contributions: M.G., E.B., L.M., S.M., L.C., R.C., and A.R. designed research; M.G.,\nE.B., L.M., S.M., L.C., R.C., and A.R. performed research; E.B., L.M., S.M., and L.C. analyzed\ndata; and M.G., E.B., L.M., S.M., L.C., R.C., and A.R. wrote the paper.y\nReviewers: A.P.D., Princeton University; and G.P., Sapienza University of Rome.y\nThe authors declare no competing interest.y\nThis open access article is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0\n(CC BY).y\n1\nTo whom correspondence may be addressed.

For these reasons, we believe that these major sources\nof uncertainty could be partially offset by estimating the model\nparameters by using only reported data on hospitalizations, fatality rates, and recovered individuals, without considering the\nstatistics on reported infections.\nWe concentrate on estimating the effects of severe progressive restrictions posed to human mobility and human-to-human\ncontacts in Italy (Materials and Methods; see also timeline in\nFig. 2).\nOur quantitative tools (31–36) are Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) parameter estimation (Materials and Methods) and the extended use of a metacommunity Susceptible–\nExposed–Infected–Recovered (SEIR)-like disease transmission\nmodel (Materials and Methods) that includes a network of 107\nnodes representative of closely monitored Italian provinces and\nmetropolitan areas (second administrative level). We use all publicly available epidemiological data, detailed information about\nhuman mobility among the nodes (i.e., fluxes and connections;\nMaterials and Methods), and updates on containment measures\nand their effects by relying also on mobile phone tracking (37).\nTheir effective implementation is generally a matter of concern\n(38). As explained in Materials and Methods, the compartments\nof the model are susceptibles (S), exposed (E), presymptom\n(P), symptomatic infectious (I), and asymptomatic infectious\n(A) (core SEPIA model) (Materials and Methods). The results of\nparameter estimation allow us to analyze the relative importance\nof containment measures and of the various epidemiological\ncompartments and their process parameters, which were also discussed in the context of spatially implicit models, for example,\nin refs. 3–6, 13, 14, 25, 26, and 39. This is true, in particular,\nfor the critical compartments of asymptomatic (5, 6, 9, 28) and\nof presymptom infectious individuals (see below). As the model\nis spatially explicit, we implement a generalized reproduction\nnumber, that is, the spectral radius of a next-generation matrix\n(NGM) (35, 36, 40, 41), that measures the potential spread in the\nabsence of containment interventions (Materials and Methods).\nWe also calculate the dominant eigenvalue (and the corresponding eigenvector) of a suitable Jacobian matrix that provides\nan estimate of the exponential rate of case increase within a\ndisease-free population, and the related asymptotic geographic\ndistribution of the infectious (35, 36). In case of time-varying\nparameters, significant technical complications would arise [e.g.,\ncomputing Floquet (42) or Lyapunov exponents (43)]. Numerical simulation then supplies directly the desired scenarios in the\npresence of time-varying containment measures.\nA critical issue concerns the description of human mobility that determines exposures and thus, ultimately, the extent\nof the contagion (28). Although the dense social contact networks characteristic of urban areas may be seen as the fabric\nfor disease propagation, calling for specific treatment of “synthetic populations” (44, 45), here, because of 1) the large number\nof cases involved, 2) the countrywide scale of the domain, and\n3) the scope of the study aimed at broad large-scale effects of\nemergency management, we choose to represent node-to-node\nfluxes from data neglecting demographic stochasticity (but see\nrefs. 14 and 29) and social contact details. Stochasticity is considered through locally estimated seeding of cases surrogating\nrandomness in mobility, which had been considered earlier in\nthe framework of branching processes (14). Coupling this information with the epidemiological data allows us to estimate the\neffects of enforced or hypothesized containment measures in\nterms of averted hospitalizations. This yields scenarios on what\ncourse the disease might have taken if different measures had\nbeen implemented.\nResults\nR0 = 3.60 (95% CI: 3.49 to 3.84) is the estimate of the initial\ngeneralized reproduction number, which includes mobility and\nthe spatial distribution of communities (Materials and Methods).\nThe full set of estimated parameters is reported in Table 2, while\nthe comparisons between model simulations and data are shown\nin Fig. 3 for five representative regions and the whole of Italy\n(the remaining regions are reported in SI Appendix, Fig. S12).

A graph representation of the spatial NGM (Materials and Methods) is shown later\n(see Fig. 5C). Crucially, the dominant eigenvalue (g0 = 0.24 d−1\n[95% CI: 0.22 to 0.26]) of the system’s Jacobian matrix, evaluated at the disease-free equilibrium, provides an estimate of\nthe initial exponential rate of case increase. The eigenvector\ncorresponding to the leading eigenvalue, which represents the\nexpected spatial distribution of cases in the asymptotic phase of\nexponential epidemic growth (35, 36), is shown in SI Appendix,\nFig. S13. The main result emerging therein is that a completely\nuncontrolled epidemic would have eventually hit mostly the main\nmetropolitan areas.\nWe estimate that containment measures and changes in social\nbehavior and awareness have progressively reduced the transmission by 45% (95% CI: 42 to 49%). The first set of measures\nresulted in a reduction of the transmission parameter, βP in\nTable 2, by 18%, while the second set of measures further\nreduces it by an additional 34%.\nFig. 4 reports, for the whole of Italy, three different scenarios in terms of the cumulative number of hospitalizations. We\nchose to represent only this state variable for clarity, and for the\nobvious implications on emergency management. The baseline\nshown in Fig. 4 is the one in which the model has been identified\n(lower curve and data) by including changes in the spatial human\nmobility and in collective social behavior, jointly with their timing\n(Materials and Methods). The other two curves represent “what\nif” scenarios. The first (scenario A), corresponding to the middle curve in the graph, is the one in which only the first set of\ncontainment measures is implemented. The second (scenario B),\nportrayed by the upper curve, is obtained by excluding all containment measures. The comparison between scenarios allows\nus to estimate the number of averted cases (excess of hospitalization demand with respect to the baseline), jointly with their\nspatial distributions (maps of scenarios A and B in Fig. 4). The\nactual number of averted cases is obtained by the difference of\nhospitalizations between the baseline and scenario B (no containment measures). We obtain a median of 0.226 · 106\naverted\ncases (95% CI: 0.172 · 106\nto 0.347 · 106\n), as of March 25, 2020.\nAn analogous plot for the total averted infections is shown in\nSI Appendix, Fig. S14. Therein, one notes that the total infections\nare calculated by integrating in time the force of the infection,\nthat is, the sum over all 107 nodes i of the flux (λiSi(t); see\nMaterials and Methods) leaving the susceptibles compartment.\nThe number of averted cases is computed as discussed for the\nresults on hospitalizations in Fig. 4. The median number of\naverted infections due to the implementation of all restriction\nmeasures is 6.49 · 106\n(95% CI: 4.81 − 10.1 · 106\n). Our median\nestimate of the total number of infections, as of March 25, 2020,\nis approximately 733, 000 individuals.\nDiscussion\nGlobalized societies are challenged by emerging diseases, in\nmany cases, zoonoses (46), often related to climate change (47,\n48). COVID-19 is a paradigmatic example of zoonosis whose\npandemic character is tied to the globalized travel that spread\nthe contagion in a few months (11, 12). Scientific and technological advances in a variety of fields provide a broad availability\nof data and modeling tools that must inform decision-making on\nemergency management. This exercise intends to contribute to\nthis cross-fertilization.\nHere, we have developed and implemented a spatial framework for the ongoing COVID-19 emergency in Italy, which is\ncharacterized by evident spatial signatures (SI Movies S1 and\nS2 clearly show the radiation of the epidemic along highways\nand transportation infrastructures). Our analysis of the contributions of different compartments points to the important\nrole played by presymptom infectious in the disease spread and\n10486 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2004978117 Gatto et al.\nDownloaded by guest on April 15, 2021 \nMEDICAL SCIENCES\n101\nFeb 24 Mar 02 Mar 09 Mar 16 Mar 23\n1\n2\n3\n4\nCumulated hospitalized cases [x105\n]\n0\n105\n102\n103\n104\nScenario A Scenario B\nBaseline scenario\nScenario B: no restriction measures\nScenario A: February, but no March restrictions\nFig. 4.

The map of scenario A shows the corresponding\nexpected increase of hospitalization demand with respect to the baseline\nas of March 25, 2020. The uppermost curve (dotted line, scenario B) shows\nthe expected hospitalizations, had no restrictive measure been imposed.\nThe map of scenario B shows the corresponding increase of hospitalization\ndemand.\ngrowth (Table 2). The estimated high presymptomatic transmission parameter βP , with respect to the transmission rates of\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious βI ,A, reproduces field\nepidemiological evidence (49) and provides support for explicitly\naccounting for the presymptomatic compartment in the SEPIA\nmodel. This result may have profound implications for containment measures [possibly even centralized quarantines (50)],\nbecause it may suggest the need for a massive swab testing to\nidentify and isolate presymptomatic infectious cases (51). This\nunderpins that greatly improved contact tracing has the potential\nto stop the spread of the epidemic if reliably used on sufficiently\nlarge numbers (52).\nThe lockdown introduced in Italy by the second set of measures was far more stringent than the first. As a consequence,\nnoted in Results, the transmission rates have been progressively\nand significantly reduced. The different age of the measures\n(current time minus its onset) has therefore produced different\neffects. This needs to be accounted for, to properly judge their\neffectiveness. At first sight, in fact, the effects of the second set of\nmeasures taken in March could erroneously appear less important than in reality (A in Fig. 4). Obviously, the effects of the\nsecond set of measures will fully display their importance after\nMarch 25, 2020, the end date for our analysis.\nOur study presents a number of simplifications and limitations\nthat, however, do not impair our main conclusions. Specifically,\n1) although the human effort involved in the collection of epidemiological data has been major, the granularity of available\ndata is limited in time, spatial resolution, and individual information [for instance, the only published assessment of mobility changes in Italy following lockdown (37) refers to publicly\nunavailable data; properly anonymized call detail records have\nbeen useful in other epidemic and endemic contexts (34, 53, 54)];\n2) should anonymized individual information from hospitals and\nlaboratories be available, a proper probability distribution of\nrelevant rates and periods (e.g., latency, incubation, infection)\ncould be employed by any modeling approaches (see ref. 55 for\nestimates based on high data granularity regarding the Lombardy region); and 3) the effect of age structure (56) in terms\nof differential mobility, social contact patterns, vulnerability, and\ncase fatality ratio [often associated with hyperinflammation in\nelderly people (57)] would need to be included, therefore relying\non higher granularity of data (39). Further developments may\nalso deal with operational predictions based on our modeling\nframework, once coupled, for example, to ensemble Kalman filtering and updates of parameter estimates and state variables,\nas already customary in other epidemiological studies (58–60),\nand currently employed only in a few studies on COVID-19\n(28, 61). The spatial nature of the model, in fact, would possibly aid the planning of the agenda for differential mobility\nrestrictions and deployments of local medical supplies and staff\ntuned to local epidemiological and logistic conditions. We do\nnot attempt, at this stage, to simulate the long-term evolution of the disease dynamics, because it depends on the time\nevolution of the conditions determining critical epidemiological\nparameters such as people’s behavior and contact rates, further\nrestrictions to mobility, or the discovery of new specific antiviral\ndrugs (62).\nCij\nX\nPotentially mobile Infective\ni\nj\nk\nCji\nX\nCkj\nX\nCjk\nX\nCki\nX\nCik\nX\nTransportation network\nA B\nTop 5% Top 1%\nSi Ei Pi\nHi I\ni Ai\nDi Ri\nλ δE\nσδ P\n(1-σ)δ P\n(1-ζ)η\nαH αI\nγ H\nγI γA\nQi\nζη\nγ Q\nC\nFig. 5.

We find a significantly larger figure than in the official counts: as of March 25, 2020, we estimate a\nmedian of about 600, 000 contagions, whereas the official count\nof confirmed infections is 74, 386. This result does not confirm\nearlier, much larger estimates (63). However, the estimation of\ncertain key epidemiological parameters proves remarkably similar in ref. 63 and in this paper, possibly providing an avenue for\nfuture convergence.\nWe conclude that a detailed spatially explicit model of the\nunfolding COVID-19 spread in Italy, inclusive of the imposed\nrestriction measures, closely reproduces the empirical evidence.\nThis allows us to draw significant indications of the key processes\ninvolved in the contagion, together with their time-dependent\nnature and parameters. When applied by restarting the\nsimulation while removing the restrictive measures, the model\nshows, unequivocally, that their effects have been decisive.\nIndeed, the total expected number of averted hospitalizations\nin Italy, a significant measure of the needs of emergency management (and the less error-prone epidemiological measure),\nran on the order of 200, 000 cases up to March 25, 2020, for\nthe whole country, and is known with sufficient spatial granularity. Implications on fatality rates and emergency management\nare direct, as the capacity of the Italian medical facilities—\nalthough continuously expanding—is known at each relevant\ntime. Thus our results bear social and economic significance,\nbecause they unquestionably support drastic governmental\ndecisions.\nTable 1.

Many models have been developed to describe the\ncourse of the COVID-19 pandemic in individual countries or at the global\nscale. Actually, no clear consensus has been reached on the different compartments that should be included in a proper model. Our model choice\nwas motivated by a review of the existing approaches. Most models assume\na standard SEIR structure but make different hypotheses on the nature of\nthe different compartments and their respective residence times. Some of\nthe key epidemiological features characteristic of COVID-19 are summarized\nin Table 1, together with the appropriate references, while the different\napproaches are described in more detail in SI Appendix.\nHere, we propose and use a model that is elaborated moving from\nthe basic local scheme of ref. 5. By introducing the new compartment of\npresymptomatic infectious individuals, we account for a peculiar epidemiological state of the disease under study. Empirical evidence (see again\nTable 1) shows, in fact, that the serial interval of COVID-19 tends to be\nshorter than the incubation period, thus suggesting that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission can occur prior to illness onset (68).\nPresymptom transmission appears to play an important role in speeding\nup the spread of the disease within a community, accounting for around\n12.6% of case reports in China (49), 48% in Singapore, and 62% in Tianjin,\nChina (74). The core of our model is thus termed SEPIA and includes the\nfollowing compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Presymptomatic (P),\nInfected with heavy symptoms (I), Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic (A),\nHospitalized (H), Quarantined at home (Q), Recovered (R), and Dead (D)\nindividuals.\nThe local dynamics of transmission is given by\n˙S = −λS\nE˙ = λS − δEE\nP˙ = δEE − δPP\n˙\nI = σδPP − (η + γI + αI)I\nA˙ = (1 − σ)δPP − γAA\nH˙ = (1 − ζ)ηI − (γH + αH)H\nQ˙ = ζηI − γQQ\nR˙ = γI\nI + γAA + γHH\nD˙ = αI\nI + αHH.\n[1]\nIn the model, susceptible individuals (S) become exposed to the viral\nagent upon contact with infectious individuals, assumed to be those in the\npresymptomatic, heavily symptomatic, or asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic\nclasses. Although the hypothesis might not hold for some very sparse communities, we assume frequency-dependent contact rates (as most authors\ndo), so that exposure occurs at a rate described by the force of infection,\nλ =\nβPP + βI\nI + βAA\nS + E + P + I + A + R\n,\nwhere βP, βI\n, and βA are the specific transmission rates of the three infectious classes. Exposed individuals (E) are latently infected, that is, still not\ncontagious, until they enter the presymptom stage (at rate δE) and only\nthen become infectious. Presymptomatic individuals (P) progress (at rate δP)\nto become symptomatic infectious individuals who develop severe symptoms (with probability σ). Alternatively, they become asymptomatic/mildly\nsymptomatic individuals (with probability 1 − σ). Symptomatic infectious\nindividuals (I) exit their compartment if/when 1) they are isolated from\nthe community (at rate η) because a fraction 1 − ζ of them is hospitalized, while a fraction ζ is quarantined at home, 2) they recover from\ninfection (at rate γI), or 3) they die (at rate αI). Asymptomatic/mildly\nsymptomatic individuals (A), on the other hand, leave their compartment\nafter having recovered from infection (at rate γA). Hospitalized individuals (H) may either recover from infection (at rate γH) or die because\nof it (at rate αH), while home-isolated individuals (Q) leave their compartment upon recovery (at rate γQ). People who recover from infection\nor die because of COVID-19 populate the class of recovered (R) and\ndead (D) individuals, respectively, independently of their epidemiological\ncompartment of origin.\nThe model is made spatial by coupling n human communities at the suitable resolution via a community-dependent force of infection. It results\nfrom local and imported infections due to contacts within the local community or associated with citizens’ mobility. More precisely, the force of\ninfection for community i is given by\n10488 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2004978117 Gatto et al.\nDownloaded by guest on April 15, 2021 \nMEDICAL SCIENCES\nλi =\nXn\nj=1\nC\nS\nij\nP\nY∈{P,I,A}\nPn\nk=1 βY C\nY\nkjYk P\nX∈{S,E,P,I,A,R}\nPn\nk=1\nC\nX\nkjXk\n,\nwhere C\nX\nij (with X ∈ {S, E, P, I, A, R}) is the probability (Pn\nj=1\nC\nX\nij = 1 for all i\nand X) that individuals in epidemiological state X who are from community i\nenter into contact with individuals who are present at community j as either\nresidents or because they are traveling there from community k (note that\ni, j, and k may coincide). Details are provided in SI Appendix.\nA frequently used indicator is the basic reproduction number, namely, the\nnumber R0 of secondary infections produced by one primary infection in a\nfully susceptible population. This simple concept works fine in a spatially\nisolated community, where everything is well mixed at any instant. Instead,\nif the model parameters are inhomogeneous both in space and in time, the\nnumber of secondary infections produced by one primary infection might\nvary accordingly. Also, R0 may depend on people’s behavior and on the control measures being enforced. When a realistic spatial model is introduced\nto describe the spread in a country, it is necessary to resort to the definition of generalized reproduction numbers based on the spectral radius of a\nsuitable epidemiological matrix (35, 36, 40).\nIf we consider the spatial model described above in the case when no\nemergency measures are enforced and people’s behavior does not change,\nthen the basic reproduction number can be calculated as (see SI Appendix\nfor the detailed derivation)\nR0 = ρ(KL) = ρ(GP + GI + GA),\nwhere ρ(KL) is the spectral radius of the NGM (40) and\nGP =\nβP\nδP\nGCT\nP\n, GI =\nβIGCT\nI\nη + γI + αI\n, GA =\nβA\nγA\nGCT\nA\nare three spatially explicit generation matrices describing the contributions\nof 1) presymptom infectious, 2) infectious with severe symptoms, and 3)\ninfectious with no/mild symptoms, to the production of new infections\nclose to the disease-free equilibrium.

Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has quickly become not only the defining public health\nchallenge of our time but also the greatest economic threat since the Great Recession. As cases\nbegan to emerge in the United States in March of 2020, states and localities implemented social\ndistancing restrictions that varied in timing and scope. In Kentucky, the first major interventions\ntook effect on March 16, when Governor Andy Beshear closed public schools and the dining-in\nsections of restaurants and bars (Beshear, 2020). Governor Beshear soon closed other nonessential businesses, banned large gatherings, and ultimately declared that the state’s “Healthy at\nHome” directive was functionally equivalent to the shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs) enacted in\nmost states (Baker, 2020; Aulbach, 2020). These suppression measures are recommended as a\nnecessary step in a recent road map by American Enterprise Institute to reopening the economy\n(Gottlieb et al., 2020).\nThe “Opening Up America Again” guidelines issued by the Trump administration\nidentify conditions when a state can safely proceed to a gradual reopening. These include a\ndownward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period (or positive tests as a percent\nof total tests), sufficient health care capacity such that hospitals can safely able to treat all\npatients without crisis care, and a robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers,\nincluding emerging antibody testing (The White House, 2020). With states beginning to\ngradually reopen parts of their economies as part of this phase, evidence to help policymakers\nstrike the best balance between protecting public health and avoiding continued economic\ncollapse is urgently needed. If less invasive restrictions such as school closures and large event\nbans can achieve nearly the same reduction in COVID-19 case growth as more comprehensive\nmeasures such as SIPOs, then extreme restrictions are likely not necessary moving forward. In \n3\ncontrast, if strong measures are the only way to achieve substantial mitigation, then the benefits\nof lengthy SIPOs could outweigh their substantial costs.\nTheoretically, the extent to which SIPOs flatten the curve once closures of schools and\nmany types of businesses are already in place is unclear. On one hand, SIPOs may be largely\nredundant if the main sources of community spread have already been eliminated. SIPOs are also\ndifficult to enforce and many (including Kentucky’s) do not specify formal penalties for\nviolations (Mazziotta, 2020). SIPOs may therefore be best characterized as a “nudge” with social\npressure being the main channel through which they could work (Thaler and Sunstein, 2009). On\nthe other hand, SIPOs might be necessary if closing gathering places like schools and restaurants\nsimply redirects social activities towards other settings, such as parks or houses. Explicitly\nprohibiting such gatherings in all settings, including informal ones, may be necessary to\nsubstantially slow the spread.\nEpidemiological models link the frequency and nature of social interactions to case\ngrowth but tend to simply assume that particular government restrictions can reduce these\ninteractions to a given level. For instance, Thunstrom et al. (forthcoming) rely on measures from\nthe 1918 influenza pandemic to assume that social-distancing measures will reduce the average\ncontact rate by 38 percent. The well-known Imperial College London and University of\nWashington models project case trajectories with social distancing versus no social distancing,\nbut they are agnostic about how the specified level of social distancing will be achieved\n(Ferguson et al., 2020; The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2020). Economists’\npolicy evaluation toolkit can therefore help fill a critical void in the literature.\nAccordingly, recent studies provide evidence on the effectiveness of these socialdistancing measures in the U.S., but their relevance for Kentucky is unclear. Abouk and Heydari \n4\n(2020), Andersen (2020), Engle, Stromme and Zhou (2020), Gubta et al. (2020), Painter and Qiu\n(2020), Siedner et al. (2020) and Tucker and Yu (2020) all use publicly available aggregated\nmobility data obtained from cell phones to document the extent to which social distancing\nrestrictions influence movement. Friedson et al. (2020) find that California’s SIPO reduced\nCOVID-19 case growth in the first three weeks following its implementation, while Dave et al.\n(2020) find evidence that SIPOs are most effective in early adopting states and those with high\npopulation densities. Siedner et al. (2020) find that early social distancing restrictions of any\ntype, but not later SIPOs, decreased states’ COVID-19 growth rates. In cross-sectional state-level\nanalyses, Orazem (2020) and Reilly (2020) do not find evidence that SIPOs inhibit COVID-19\ncaseload growth. Courtemanche et al. (2020) estimate an event-study model with all U.S.\ncounties and show that SIPOs strongly reduced the growth rate of COVID-19 cases, while\nclosing entertainment-related businesses had a moderate effect. However, they find no evidence\nthat closing public schools or banning large gatherings reduced case growth without a broader\nSIPO also being in place.\nWe conduct a similar analysis to Courtemanche et al. (2020) but with a unique focus on\nKentucky – a state whose early, aggressive actions to curb the spread of coronavirus, particularly\nrelative to the slower response by its neighbor Tennessee – received international attention\n(Lenthang, 2020; National Public Radio, 2020). First, rather than estimating the model for the\nentire U.S., we limit the sample to counties in the states in the South and Midwest Census\nRegions, which are more comparable to Kentucky than the Northeast and West Census Regions\nthat we leave out (U.S. Census Bureau). We then use the results to estimate how the COVID-19\ncurve could have evolved in Kentucky without government-imposed social distancing\nrestrictions – i.e. relying only on voluntary social-distancing measures taken by individuals and \n5\nbusinesses. In effect, the model leverages the fact that other states and counties in the South and\nMidwest implemented different social distancing restrictions than Kentucky, or implemented the\nsame restrictions at different times, to make counterfactual predictions about what would have\nhappened in Kentucky under different policy choices.\nSimilarly to the Courtemanche et al. (2020) results for the entire U.S., we find that SIPOs\nwere the most effective policy in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in the Midwest and South;\nclosing entertainment-related facilities such as restaurants, bars, gyms, and entertainment centers\nwas the second most effective; and closing schools and banning large events in the absence of a\nSIPO had no statistically or economically significant effect. The combined impact of all of these\nmeasures in Kentucky was to limit the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases to 3,857 by April\n25, compared to the 44,482 that our model predicts would have occurred in their absence.\nII. Data\nOur dataset includes daily official case counts from each of the 2,477 counties (or\nequivalents such as parishes and independent cities) in the South and Midwest. Following\nCourtemanche et al. (2020), our sample period starts on March 5, 2020, the day the U.S. reached\n100 total cases (and the starting point on many graphs in the popular press of COVID-19 case\ngrowth). This was also the day before Kentucky’s first official case. Our sample period ends on\nApril 25. The resulting sample size is 128,804 county-by-day observations. In all analyses, each\ncounty observation is weighted by population using 2018 estimates (United States Department of\nAgriculture, 2019).\nOur COVID-19 case data come from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and\nEngineering’s 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Data Repository, which includes information\nfrom an array of sources such as government and independent health institutions (Johns Hopkins \n6\nUniversity & Medicine, 2020). We use these data to compute each county’s daily exponential\ngrowth rate in confirmed COVID-19 cases, which is equal to the natural log of daily COVID-19\ncases minus the log of daily COVID-19 cases on the prior day, multiplied by 100 to be\ninterpretable as percent. Following Bursztyn et al. (2020), we add one to the case totals to\nprevent the log of cases from being undefined when there are no cases in a county on a given\nday. The sample mean is 507 cases, so adding one is only a small distortion that does not\nmaterially impact the results. The growth rate was multiplied by 100 and can be read as\npercentage point changes.\nOur information on state and local government social-distancing interventions comes\nfrom Killeen et al. (2020). As explained in Courtemanche et al. (2020), we corrected a few errors\nin the dates, and our final lists of state- and county-level policies are shown in that study. The\nmajority of the policy variation, including all variation in Kentucky, is at the state level, but a\nnumber of counties implemented restrictions prior to the state, and our use of county-level data\nallows these restrictions to be incorporated.\nAs in Courtemanche et al. (2020), we study four separate interventions. One is whether\npublic schools were closed, with the closure coded as taking effect on the first cancelled school\nday. This was March 16 in Kentucky. Another is whether there was a closure of at least some\nentertainment-related businesses. Formally, this is an indicator for either restaurant dining areas\n(including bars) or gyms/entertainment centers being closed. In practice, the two types of\nclosures were almost always enacted at either the same time or close to it. In Kentucky,\nrestaurants were closed on March 16 and gyms, entertainment centers, and other businesses that\ninvolve gathering were closed just two days later; this variable is therefore set to one starting on\nMarch 16. The third intervention is a ban on large gatherings that is at least as restrictive as 500 \n7\nor more people. Most such bans, including Kentucky’s (which took effect on March 20), applied\nto gatherings of 50 or more people. Finally, the strongest restriction is the SIPO. Killeen et al.\n(2020) code Kentucky’s SIPO as starting on March 26. While Governor Beshear has not\nofficially used the term SIPO, March 26 is the date he closed all non-life-sustaining business,\nwhich made Kentucky’s “Healthy at Home” initiative functionally equivalent to the SIPOs in\nplace in other states.\nOur sample period begins on March 5, 2020, which is the day before Kentucky reported\nits first case. The number of COVID-19 cases in Kentucky grew to 3,857 by April 25, the last\nday in our sample. Figure 1 illustrates the reach of social-distancing policies on the population in\nthe Midwest and South over time relative to the timing of Kentucky in implementing these\nmeasures (indicated by the vertical red lines). 22 percent of the population in the South and\nMidwest lived in counties where schools were already closed when Kentucky’s closure took\neffect. 41 percent of the population in these regions lived in counties with restaurant or\nentertainment center closures when Kentucky did so. When Kentucky officially banned large\ngatherings, similar orders already affected 73 percent of people in these regions. About 46\npercent of the population in these regions was covered by a SIPO at the time of Kentucky’s\nequivalent measure. On balance, then, Kentucky was implemented social-distancing restrictions\nsomewhat earlier that other Midwestern and Southern states but was not an outlier.\nIII. Econometric Model\nOur econometric model is an event-study-style generalization of the standard differencein-differences framework. Whereas difference-in-differences models include the interaction of\nindicators for treatment group and whether the time is post-treatment, an event-study model\nallows for more flexible timing of impacts by interacting treatment with several indicators of \n8\ntime relative to treatment. Differentiating between the effects of treatments that just occurred\nversus those that occurred a longer time ago may be particularly valuable in the case of COVID19, where the effects of social-distancing restrictions are likely to be gradual due to incubation\nperiods, delays seeking medical care after the onset of symptoms, delays obtaining COVID-19\ntests after seeking care, and waits for test results (Lauer et al., 2020). Additionally, event study\nmodels include indicators reflecting time before treatment, allowing for an evaluation of pretreatment trends. If divergence between the trends of the treatment and control groups emerges\nprior to treatment, then the observed relationships reflect unobserved confounders or reverse\ncausality rather than the causal effect of the intervention on the outcome.\nFollowing Courtemanche et al. (2020), our event-study model contains six variables for\neach of the four types of social-distancing policies: whether it was implemented\n• 1-5 days ago,\n• 6-10 days ago,\n• 11-15 days ago,\n• 16 or more days ago,\n• -5 to -9 days ago (i.e. will be implemented 5-9 days from now), or\n• <-9 days ago (i.e. will be implemented 10 or more days from now).\nImplementation in the next five days (0 to -4 days ago) is the omitted reference group to which\nthe coefficients for the other time periods are compared. For instance, the coefficient on the\nvariable for “SIPO was implemented 11-15 days ago” measures the effect of starting a SIPO 11-\n15 days ago instead of in the next five days.1\n1 The Supplemental Appendix to Courtemanche et al. (2020) provides formal notation for our event-study model. \n9\nSince we include four different types of polices together in the same model, their\ncoefficients represent partial effects, holding all other types of policies constant. While the\nsequence in which the restrictions on schools, businesses, and events took effect varied across\nstates and counties, SIPOs were almost always implemented after at least one other restriction\nwas in place – usually all three. The estimated effects of SIPOs therefore represent their\nadditional impacts above and beyond prior closures. The “full” impact of issuing a SIPO –\nwhich, by definition, encompasses the other smaller restrictions – without any prior restrictions\nis better measured as the linear combination of the coefficients of all four policy variables in the\nspecified time frame.\nOther covariates in our model are county and day fixed effects; i.e. dummy variables for\neach county and each day in the sample. The county fixed effects capture determinants of\ncounties’ COVID-19 case growth rates that do not appreciably change throughout the sample\nperiod, such as population density, demographic characteristics of the population, and political\norientation (Wright et al., 2020; Painter and Qiu, 2020). The day fixed effects capture common\nshocks to case growth rates shared by all counties in the U.S., such as voluntary social distancing\nin response to CDC guidance and other nationwide sources of information, international travel\nbans, and national trends in testing access. Therefore, the ability to interpret our results as causal\neffects of the policies rests on the assumption that these unmeasured factors do not change\ndifferentially across counties over time in a way that is correlated with the timing of the policies’\nimplementation.\nCourtemanche et al. (2020) report results from numerous robustness checks designed to\nrule out threats to the validity of this model. Their first few checks show that their statistically\ninsignificant results for school closures and event bans are not due to insufficient identifying \n10\nvariation independent from the other policies. Their other checks provide evidence that their\nmain conclusions are not sensitive to excluding unique early outbreak states, constructing the\npolicy variables in other defensible ways, imputing or excluding certain questionable\nobservations in the case data, starting the sample at a different time, controlling for number of\ntests performed in the state, and controlling for county-specific pre-treatment trends in case\ngrowth rate. In unreported regressions (results available upon request), we have verified that the\nresults are similarly robust to these checks in our dataset, which differs from theirs only in that\nwe include nine additional days of data and exclude the West and Northeast Census Regions.\nIV. Results\nThe coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals for the four social-distancing policies\nobtained from the event-study are displayed in Figure 2. The confidence intervals are based on\nstandard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity and clustering by state. A variable is\nstatistically significant at the 5% level if its coefficient’s confidence interval does not include\nzero.\nThe upper left panel of Figure 2 shows that SIPOs led to a gradual but substantial\nreduction in the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. In the first time period after the implementation\n(1-5 days), the growth rate fell by a statistically insignificant 2.4 percentage points relative to the\nreference period of the five days before implementation. The effect became statistically\nsignificant in each subsequent period, growing to 3.9 percentage points after 6-10 days, 5.3\npercentage points after 11-15 days, and 8 percentage points after 16 or more days.\nThe restrictions on restaurants and entertainment centers had a relatively steady effect on\nthe growth rate of COVID-19 cases once in place. Closing either restaurant dining areas or\ngyms/entertainment centers (usually both) lowered the growth rate by 5 percentage points in the \n11\nfirst five days after taking effect, with the impact rising only slightly – to 6.2 percentage points –\nafter 16 days. In contrast, however, we found no evidence that bans on large social gatherings or\nschool closures reduced growth rates after any length of time, holding the other types of policies\nconstant. The estimated effect of event bans is nearly zero and statistically insignificant, while\nthe effect of closing schools is consistently positive (faster case growth), though never\nsignificant.\nFor all four types of policies, we observe no “placebo” effect on the pre-enactment\ngrowth rate. All coefficient estimates representing “impacts” of future implementation are small\nand statistically insignificant. In other words, we find no evidence of bias from reverse causality\n(case growth driving policy implementation) or unobserved confounders.\nAs discussed previously, the combined effects of all four policies is the best estimate of\nthe overall impact of government-imposed social distancing restrictions. This combined effect\nwas 5.4 percentage points in the first five days, 6.8 percentage points after 6-10 days, 7.1\npercentage points after 11-15 days, and 9.1 percentage points after 16 or more days. Only the\nsecond and fourth of these estimates is statistically significant at the 5% level, with the first and\nthird having p-values of 0.16 and 0.12, respectively. These estimates are relatively similar to\nthose for SIPOs alone, as the positive (though insignificant) effect of closing schools on case\ngrowth was roughly offset by the reduction from restaurant/gym/entertainment center closures.\nIn other words, on average, states’ and counties’ early social distancing efforts made little\ndifference in slowing the spread of COVID-19, but stronger measures implemented later were\nmore successful.\nV. COVID-19 Case Growth Rate in Kentucky without Social-Distancing Policies\n12\nWe next use these regression results to simulate a counterfactual scenario in which no\njurisdiction in Kentucky ever implemented any social distancing restriction. To calculate the\nnumber of counterfactual cases, we first predict the counterfactual growth rate from the\nregression estimates discussed above by setting all of the post-implementation policy variables\nequal to zero. We do not also subtract out the “placebo” effects of the future policy\nimplementation variables, since those are intended to capture unobserved confounders rather\nthan part of the causal effect of the policies. The number of predicted cases on a given day is\neasily calculated from cases on the previous day and the predicted growth rate.2 Once the\nnumber of cases in each county and day is predicted under the given counterfactual, we can sum\nthem by day to create state-by-day predicted cases. Those predicted counterfactual totals are\nestimates of how many cases the state would have if no social distancing policies had been\nimplemented.\nFigure 3 compares the reported number of observed COVID-19 cases in Kentucky over\ntime to the number of cases predicted by our event-study regression estimates under the\naforementioned counterfactual scenario of no social distancing policies. The graph in the left\npanel uses the natural logarithm of Kentucky cases (or predicted cases) for the y-axis scale, but\nwith corresponding numbers (in thousands) labeled on the y-axis instead of logs. The graph in\nthe right panel shows presents the same numbers on a linear scale.\nBoth counterfactual and observed cases increase roughly linearly on the log scale, as\nexpected under exponential growth, until the beginning of April – approximately two weeks after\nthe first restrictions and one week after the first SIPO. The actual path of observed cases on the\nlog scale then begins to flatten substantially, while cases predicted under the counterfactual\n2 The details of this calculation, which uses the fact that the exponential function is the inverse of the natural\nlogarithm, can be found in Courtemanche et al. (2020).\n13\nscenario deviate very little from their existing path. The exponential growth rate of cases under\nthe counterfactual is especially striking on the linear scale in the right panel. By April 25, the\nobserved number of cases reached 3,857. If no social-distancing measures had been\nimplemented, our estimates predict the number of cases would have been 44,482.\nVI. Conclusion\nThe finding on reduced growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases from our regional model\nthat includes Kentucky finds strong agreement with other recent, credible studies on the impact\nof social distancing measures in California (Friedson et al., 2020) and across the U.S. as a whole\n(Courtemanche et al., 2020; Dave et al., 2020). Our results are also consistent with evidence that\nSIPOs and closures of restaurants/entertainment facilities reduce cell-phone-tracked measures of\nmobility, while school closures and bans on medium-sized events do not (Abouk and Heydari,\n2020; Andersen, 2020). Although the confirmed case counts that we use to create growth rates\nunderstate true prevalence (Hortaçsu, Liu and Schwieg, 2020; Bendavid et al., 2020), they are a\ncritical metric in the Trump administration’s “Opening Up America Again” plan (The White\nHouse, 2020). The plan proposes either a “downward trajectory of documented cases within a\n14-day period” or “downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-\nday period (flat or increasing volume of tests)” as criteria to loosening social distancing\nmeasures.\nMany SIPOs are set to expire in the near future, and some of Kentucky’s neighbors are\nreopening (Mervosh and Lee 2020). Georgia, which has had a SIPO in place since April 3,\nallowed gyms, hair and nail salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors to reopen on April 24, and\nrestaurants, movie theaters, and other entertainment to reopen on April 27. Oklahoma did not\nhave a SIPO, but lifted restrictions on salons, barbers and pet groomers on April 24, and \n14\nscheduled restaurant dining, movie theaters, gyms, houses of worship and sporting venues to\nreopen on May 1. South Carolina’s SIPO has been in effect since April 7, and began reopening\non April 20 with retail stores, operating at reduced capacity. Tennessee’s SIPO is set to expire\nApril 30, although restaurants will reopen starting April 27, with retail stores to follow, both\noperating at reduced capacity.\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (2020) projects June 14 as the day\nKentucky can consider relaxing social distancing measures with a containment strategy. Some of\nthe other states that are currently relaxing social distancing measures – Georgia, Oklahoma,\nSouth Carolina, and Tennessee – have projections of June 22, June 17, June 8, and May 20,\nrespectively. According to these projections, few states are currently positioned to reopen in the\nvery near future, even with a containment strategy (Huth and Wu, 2020).\nWeighing health benefits against economic harms – and the debate about appropriate\ntiming for reopening – will continue. Some recent analyses either deny the existence of health\nbenefits or argue that such concerns are only important for hot spots such as New York City, but\nare irrelevant elsewhere (Reilly, 2020; Rodgers, 2020). Their conclusions are based on poorly\nspecified empirical models that do not produce appropriate counterfactual findings.3 Our eventstudy model – focused on the Midwest and South – strongly rebuts the idea that social distancing\npolicies are ineffective or irrelevant. In Kentucky, our forecasts find that confirmed COVID-19\ncases would be ten times higher without government-imposed social distancing restrictions.\nKentucky’s fatality rate for confirmed cases is approximately 5 percent. Under the assumption\n3 In particular, cross-sectional analyses like those of Reilly (2020) and Rodgers (2020) cannot separate the causal\neffect of social distancing policies on the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak from the reverse-causal effect of\noutbreak severity influencing timing of adoption. This leads to bias in the direction of underestimating the\neffectiveness of the restrictions. \n15\nthat individuals who did not become confirmed cases as a result of these restrictions would have\ndied at the same rate, our results suggest that they have prevented more than 2,000 fatalities.4\nOur model’s estimates also suggest that returning to partial measures – as some\nneighboring states are – would be insufficient to curb the spread of the virus. Specifically, we\nfind no evidence that school closures and bans of moderate-sized events have any effect at all on\nthe growth rate of COVID-19 cases unless accompanied by broader shelter-in-place directives\nsuch as Kentucky’s “Healthy at Home” initiative. While such findings may appear paradoxical,\nthey are consistent with the economic concept of substitution. Certainly COVID-19 can spread at\nschools and group events, but that does not imply that closing/banning them slows the spread.\nThe effect depends on what individuals do in the absence of these activities. Kids who are out of\nschool may simply end up in different social settings such as day care or gatherings at houses.\nThose whose youth baseball seasons are postponed may still congregate at the local park for\npick-up games. Adults who can no longer go to concerts may attend house parties instead. Strong\nstay-at-home directives shut down these alternate routes of socialization and transmission.\nOf course, the practicality of lengthy SIPOs is another matter. Although a large majority\nof Americans currently believe social distancing efforts should be the top priority right now,\nviewpoints are highly partisan (CBS/YouGov, 2020). Many states – including Kentucky – have\nwitnessed small but vocal protests against SIPOs and other restrictions based on frustration about\neconomic security and individual liberty (Bogel-Burroughs and Peters, 2020). Recent\ncalculations find that the approximately 90 percent health-related benefits of the lockdown\n4 There is currently considerable debate over the true infection fatality rate, which is much lower than the case\nfatality rate because of asymptomatic or mild infections going untreated and limitations in testing access. However,\nthat debate is irrelevant here: because we measure effects on confirmed cases, the case fatality rate is the appropriate\none to use. In other words, if we were able to examine infections rather than cases, the fatality rate would be lower,\nbut the number of infections averted would be higher by the same proportion.\n16\naccrue to individuals aged 50 and over, while the job losses and economic harm accrue more to\nyounger and healthier individuals – p",

In advance of effective antiviral therapies, countries have applied different public health strategies to control spread and manage healthcare need. Sweden has taken a unique approach of not implementing strict closures, instead urging personal responsibility. We analyze the results of this and other potential strategies for pandemic control in Sweden.\n\nMethods\nWe implemented individual-based modeling of COVID-19 spread in Sweden using population, employment, and household data. Epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 were validated on a limited date range; where substantial uncertainties remained, multiple parameters were tested. The effects of different public health strategies were tested over a 160-day period, analyzed for their effects on intensive care unit (ICU) demand and death rate, and compared with Swedish data for April 2020.\n\nResults\nSwedish mortality rates are intermediate between rates for European countries that quickly imposed stringent public health controls and those for countries that acted later. Models most closely reproducing reported mortality data suggest that large portions of the population voluntarily self-isolate. Swedish ICU use rates remained lower than predicted, but a large fraction of deaths occurred in non-ICU patients. This suggests that patient prognosis was considered in ICU admission, reducing healthcare load at a cost of decreased survival in patients not admitted.\n\nConclusions\nThe Swedish COVID-19 strategy has thus far yielded a striking result: mild mandates overlaid with voluntary measures can achieve results highly similar to late-onset stringent mandates. However, this policy causes more healthcare demand and more deaths than early stringent control and depends on continued public will.\n\nCOVID-19, individual-based modeling, public health mandates, individual behavior, healthcare capacity\nTopic: intensive care unitmortalitypublic health medicinepandemicscovid-19\nIssue Section: MAJOR ARTICLES AND COMMENTARIES\nSince its emergence, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, owing to a lack of prior immunity combined with relatively high infectiousness [1–3]. This has caused substantial illness, deaths, and strain on the healthcare systems of affected countries. Reported hospitalization rates are in the range of 12% [4] to 17% [5] of diagnosed cases, increasing with age. In severely affected regions, the availability of medically necessary care has become limiting.\n\nIn advance of effective vaccines and therapies for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), countries have adopted different public health measures to reduce transmission. These have been classified as suppressive approaches, which aim to arrest transmission, and mitigation approaches, which aim to slow spread and shield vulnerable populations without truncating transmission [6, 7]. Sweden is perhaps the most prominent example of mitigation—limiting the extent of socially and economically disruptive interventions while still aiming to slow spread and allow for an effective medical response [7, 8]. Studying the effects of this strategy, which elements are key to reducing mortality rates and healthcare needs, and how it might compare with other approaches is thus of critical importance to the global understanding of pandemic responses.\n\nIn addition to direct mortality, the potential of COVID-19 to saturate national healthcare systems is a key concern, because this affects both survival of patients with COVID-19 and the ability to provide care for others in need. One critically limiting resource is the capacity of intensive care unit (ICU) beds with mechanical ventilation, given that many COVID-19 patients die from causes related to respiratory failure [9, 10]. In global settings where ICU resources were not limiting, infection fatality rates have been estimated in the range 0.36%–1.2% [11–13]. Reported Swedish case-fatality rates were relatively high at 15% for April 2020 [14], although infection fatality rates were certainly lower and much more difficult to determine reliably.\n\nNumerical models of pandemic spread provide the ability to prospectively predict the effects of different public health decisions [15] and help guide national policy [6, 7, 16–20]. In addition, they provide the critical ability to analyze, prospectively or retrospectively, which factors are key determinants of public health outcome. The absolute predictions—numbers of deaths, precise hospital use—from such models include many uncertainties, but relative predictions have been highly informative. We classify predictive models into aggregate population models that yield basic principles of epidemic spread and discrete models that take into account geographic and demographic structure, permitting more specific assessment of different interventions. Discrete models offer a particular advantage here because the nonuniform structure of individual interactions alters infection spread, and differences in demography and social network structure are potential confounders when comparing pandemic behavior across countries.\n\nIn particular, individual-based models provide a flexible platform to analyze the propagation of emerging infectious diseases and the effect of social distancing and similar behavioral changes [21]. Because household, workplace, and community structure are explicitly represented in individual-based models, they provide a natural means to examine the effects of public health strategies such as school and workplace closure or home-quarantine measures.\n\nBecause of Sweden’s unique strategy of not imposing stringent public health mandates, we used an individual-based model parameterized on Swedish demographics to assess the impact of measures deployed against COVID-19. Sweden’s approach has advertised particular reliance on social distancing and voluntary individual behaviors supplementing public health mandates, so we examined which of these measures is most likely to explain Swedish COVID-19 spread to date, what the future implications are for Sweden, and what lessons the global public health community can glean.\n\nMETHODS\nIndividual-based Model for Pandemic Spread\nWe used an individual agent-based model based on the framework published by Ferguson and coworkers [6, 22, 23] that we have reimplemented [24]. Details of the transmission model are given elsewhere [24] and briefly summarized here.\n\nGeographic and Demographic Placement\nIndividuals were assigned location, age, and household randomly sampled from Swedish demographic data [25], capturing the small household size (2.2 per household; 39.8% single-occupancy [25]) that has been postulated as a reason for COVID-19 transmission different from the rest of Europe. Households were placed on a 30-arcsec lattice using LandScan population data [26] and initially assigned 1 adult aged >20 years old. The remainder of the population for each lattice site was randomly distributed among households. In Sweden, only 5% of adults >70 years old are in congregate living facilities [25]; these were not treated explicitly.\n\nSchool and Workplace Assignment\nEach individual was placed in a school or workplace. Individuals <1 or >75 years old did not attend school or work. Schools were classified into 3 age levels, and workplaces into 2 types. Following Swedish school attendance data [27], 78% of children aged 1–3, 95% of children aged 3–5, and all children aged 6–15 years were placed in schools in their city. Students 15–22 years old were assigned to secondary and tertiary schools in their county, using the mean Swedish school size of 220 [27].\n\nIndividuals were placed in workplaces of 15 people each following Swedish employment rates: 77.3% for age 22–65 and 17.2% for age 65–75 years [25]. Approximately 95% of Swedish workplaces have 1–9 employees [25]; the 15-person size was chosen to incorporate interactions between workplaces and the skewing effect of larger workplaces. Hospitals were treated as separate workplaces, with 120 employees on average and ≥1 per county, consisting of 4.3% of the total workforce [25]. Hospital workers were considered occupationally exposed to each other as well as patients, but at 25% the exposure risk of other workplaces to account for infection-control precautions (see Supplementary Material for discussion of Swedish precautions).\n\nInitial Infections\nInitial infections were randomly seeded to match the per-county case distribution reported as of 25 March 2020 (date of Sweden’s 100th death) [14]. To correct for undertesting bias, the number of initial infections was estimated from COVID-19 ICU admissions from 17 to 31 March, using prior estimates that 2.95% of infections overall result in hospitalization, and 30% of those in ICU admission [6].\n\nTransmission Dynamics\nDisease transmission was modeled via discrete-time stochastic simulation on an individual basis; further details are given in the Supplementary Material and reported elsewhere [24]. Briefly, transmission can occur in workplaces or schools, households, and communities. An individual’s probability of becoming infected is the sum of these exposures.\n\nTransmissibility Factors\nIndividual-based models have been used for a number of emerging diseases; one key disease-specific parameter is the transmissibility within the studied population (analogous to the beta parameter in compartmental SEIR models [28]). Twenty values of this parameter were tested and selected for best agreement with either aggregate growth in cases across Europe [29] or growth in reported Swedish deaths [14] from 21 March to 6 April. The resulting transmissibility factors correspond to doubling rates of 3 days (shown in the Supplementary Material) and 5 days (main text results), respectively.\n\nStatistical Sampling\nTen independent runs were performed per parameter set; the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for measured outcomes across these runs were relatively tight, indicating that uncertainties in biological parameters rather than statistical sampling are most limiting on overall error. For death estimates, 95% CIs for age-adjusted infection fatality rates in China [11] were calculated and propagated through the model (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\nPublic Health Interventions\nSeveral public health interventions were simulated, including both universal mandates and voluntary individual behaviors. The mandates considered were chosen to approximate public health options considered or adopted elsewhere. Transmission scaling factors in each of the 9 mandate-based interventions, listed below, are based on previous work [6] and also follow our initial implementation [24].\n\nSwedish public health mandates: This intervention models Swedish government mandates (not including voluntary behavior) through April 2020. Students aged 15–22 years old did not attend school, removing school transmission and increasing community transmission by 25% and household transmission by 50%. Persons aged >70 years practiced moderate self-isolation, reducing workplace and community transmission by 75%. Symptomatic individuals self-isolated after 1 day with a 90% compliance rate, abrogating workplace transmission and reducing community transmission by 75%. Additional interventions considered below were implemented as additions to these mandates.\n\nCase isolation of entire households: Everyone sharing a household with a symptomatic person was advised to self-quarantine. For these individuals, community transmission was reduced by 75%, workplace transmission was removed, and household transmission increased by 50%. Compliance was estimated at 70% for asymptomatic and 90% for symptomatic individuals.\n\nSchool closure: All schools were closed in this intervention. Students had no school transmission, but household transmission increased by 50% and community transmission by 25%.\n\nSimple closure of schools and nonessential businesses: Schools and nonessential businesses were closed, but social distancing was not advised. School transmission was removed, workplace transmission was reduced by 75%, household transmission increased by 75%, and community transmission increased by 50%.\n\nClosure of schools and nonessential businesses with social distancing: This was as per intervention 4, but with social distancing. School transmission was removed, workplace transmission was reduced by 75%, household transmission increased by 50%, and community transmission decreased by 75%. This was practiced with 90% compliance.\n\nVoluntary work from home: A specified fraction of individuals worked from home; their community transmission was decreased by 25%, and household transmission increased by 50%.\n\nVoluntary self-isolation: A specified fraction of individuals self-isolated; their workplace transmission was removed, community transmission was decreased by 75%, and household transmission increased by 100%.\n\nVoluntary work from home overlaid on mild social distancing: As per intervention 6, but all other individuals reduced community transmission by 25%.\n\nVoluntary self-isolation overlaid on mild social distancing: As per intervention 7, but all other individuals reduced community transmission by 25%.\n\nHealthcare Capacity\nSwedish prepandemic healthcare capacity was assessed based on the most recent pan-European reports available: 5.8 ICU beds per 100 000 inhabitants [30].\n\nImplementation\nCode implementing the model and interventions tested is freely available online (https://github.com/kassonlab/covid19-epi). Data files are available on Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.3836195).\n\nRESULTS\nModels of COVID-19 spread were initialized with data for the period until 21 March, validated against reported death rates for the period from 21 March to 6 April, and evaluated against death data from 6 April onward. Because reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing was not performed on a widespread basis in Sweden, we estimated initial infections in the period until 21 March via back-calculation from ICU admissions.\n\nNumbers of infected individuals, hospitalization need, ICU admission need, and deaths were estimated using either a mandate-only strategy or a voluntary isolation strategy across a range of epidemiological parameters. These were evaluated against reported COVID-19 deaths in Sweden over the period from 6 to 30 April. The resulting mortality estimates (Figure 1 and infected individuals in Supplementary Figure 2) show that voluntary isolation can have a substantial effect on COVID mortality. Models of the Swedish public health mandates alone predict substantially more deaths in April than were reported, whereas self-isolation by a moderate fraction of the population can well reproduce the reported death toll. Although redundancies in the model parameter space and uncertainty regarding delayed death registrations preclude assignment of a unique set of “best fit” parameters, the agreement with reported death tolls demonstrates that the model is able to capture Swedish mortality data with epidemiological parameters within the range of international best estimates.\n\nFigure 1.\nPredicted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in Sweden with different voluntary adherence strategies. Plotted are median numbers of COVID-19 deaths predicted by modeling current Swedish public health mandates and individual voluntary behaviors. These are compared against reported COVID-19 deaths in Sweden. A moderate level of individual self-isolation (SI) is sufficient to well reproduce the reported death tolls.

Mobile-phone location data can provide rough estimates of this quantity. Although detailed interpretation of these data is a complex undertaking, reports from Google and others [31, 32] suggest a decrease in workplace presence of between 18% and 33% during the month of April. Our analysis is consistent with these numbers. As with any voluntary measures, adoption varied both over the course of April and in different regions of the country; those variations are not treated explicitly here. Furthermore, because diagnosed cases and deaths are lagging indicators of infection, individual modulation of voluntary measures is unlikely to result in optimal choice of control measures. For instance, premature relaxation of voluntary measures may contribute to further spread.\n\nWe also evaluated alternative public health mandates. Each of these was considered from 21 March onward, and we estimated the relative impact on mortality rate, ICU demand, and individuals infected (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3). In agreement with prior predictions [33, 34], these results suggest that strong public health mandates greatly reduce the mortality rate and healthcare needs. Surprisingly, voluntary self-isolation overlaid on the existing public health mandates achieved results within 9-fold of strong mandates at a voluntary adherence rate of 30%, within 7-fold if mild social distancing were overlaid, and within 5-fold at an adherence rate of 50% with mild social distancing. This suggests that voluntary control efforts, if widely implemented, can have a substantial effect on transmission. Working from home reduced the mortality rate and ICU demand substantially, but the decreased community transmission resulting from self-isolation had a substantial additional effect at all adherence rates. For all public health interventions considered, prompt implementation is critical to success. The predicted effects of variable delays in voluntary adherence are plotted in Figure 3, showing a substantial loss of effectiveness with increasing delay.\n\nFigure 2.\nPredicted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in Sweden with different public health mandates.

Abbreviations: SD, social distancing; SI, self-isolation; Vol, Voluntary.\n\n\nModel predictions suggest that the Swedish public health mandates alone would have resulted in approximately 40-fold more patients (median, 42-fol; 90% CI, 42–43-fold; statistical sampling not limiting on error) who could benefit from ICU care than ICU beds available before the pandemic (Figure 4). Voluntary self-isolation of 50% of the population reduced this to 5-fold (90% CI, 4.8–5.1-fold), and strong suppressive mandates would have reduced it to 1.5-fold (1.4–1.50-fold). As part of its public health response, Sweden approximately doubled its number of ICU beds during spring 2020. However, not all ICU beds were occupied—the number of unique patients receiving COVID ICU care was approximately 53% of the total COVID-diagnosed deaths at the start of May 2020 [14, 35] To analyze this, we examined the demographic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 diagnosed, patients admitted to the ICU, and patients who died with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis [25]. Analyzed by categorical age group, older Swedish patients with confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to die than to be admitted to the ICU (Figure 5), suggesting that predicted prognosis may have been a factor in ICU admission. This likely reduced ICU load at the cost of more high-risk patients dying outside the ICU.\n\nFigure 4.\nPredicted intensive care unit (ICU) demand with different mandate and voluntary strategies.

By applying only very light mandates—closure of high schools and universities only and advising isolation by symptomatic individuals and those aged >70 years—it appears to be a substantial outlier in its public health strategy. Our analysis suggests that individual actions in Sweden have created a more graduated scenario: voluntary self-isolation in Sweden has provided a combined population response intermediate between the public health mandates alone and the stronger mandate regimen implemented by other countries and regions. Sweden has had a similarly intermediate number of reported COVID-19 deaths—fewer per capita than Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom but more than its Scandinavian neighbors that implemented strong measures promptly and more than most other European countries (Supplementary Table 1; 35 of 100 000 in Sweden versus 9.3 in Denmark, 5.2 in Finland, and 4.7 in Norway, as of 15 May 2020).\n\nBenefits of the individual-response approach include increased flexibility; drawbacks include decreased coordination in the maintenance and strategic relaxation of controls. Predicted deaths and ICU demand are also greater with voluntary adherence than with stringent mandates until adherence rates exceed 75%. Whether mandated or voluntary, self-isolation of a substantial fraction of the population profoundly reduces ICU need and mortality rates if applied early and with substantial adherence rates. It therefore also follows that greater self-isolation in Sweden would have commensurately reduced deaths. Most national strategies consider both public health and economic effects of infection-control mandates; based on preliminary European data, the economic impacts on Sweden appear similar to those of its neighbors [36].\n\nOur analysis yields results qualitatively similar to those obtained using other model formalisms [8, 33]; one advantage of an individual-based model is explicit representation of demographic data, so differences between countries can be analyzed based purely on data rather than parameterized. In addition, individual-based models facilitate examination of nonuniform behaviors across a population: self-isolation by 50% of the population all the time has markedly different effects than self-isolation by all of the population 50% of the time. Different models have yielded convergent predictions that individual action can increase the efficacy of public health measures, but high adoption is necessary for disease suppression, and both rapid and sustained action are required. This suggests that the underlying findings are indeed robust.\n\nOur analyses demonstrate how individual-based modeling can account for both the unmitigated spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and its control via either suppressive measures or substantial voluntary self-isolation. We demonstrate that Sweden is likely not exceptional in its demography or other parameters controlling the epidemic spread of COVID-19; instead, the course of the pandemic in Sweden likely results from the overlay of public health mandates and individual control measures. We further note that control of ICU load during the pandemic may reflect ICU admission criteria applied. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the key biological variables controlling COVID-19 spread as well as human behavioral changes, and models of this nature are not designed to predict the future precisely. Our analyses nonetheless suggest that voluntary control strategies are highly dependent on continued individual adherence, which may prove difficult over time.\n\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

Jarvis1*†\n, Kevin Van Zandvoort1†\n, Amy Gimma1\n, Kiesha Prem1\n, CMMID COVID-19 working group,\nPetra Klepac1\n, G. James Rubin2 and W. John Edmunds1\nAbstract\nBackground: To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical\ndistancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the\nepidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases\ngenerated per case).\nMethods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The\nquestionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a\nmeasure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to\ndifferent physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a “lockdown”\nwas implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the “lockdown” to patterns of\nsocial contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction\nnumber as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published\nestimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place.\nResults: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to\n2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–\n0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22–0.53) for physical (skin to skin)\ncontacts only.\nConclusions: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels\nand will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected\ndecline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of\nsymptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking\nbehavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine\nepidemiological surveillance.\nKeywords: COVID-19, Contact survey, Pandemic, Disease outbreak, Reproduction number, nCov\n© The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,\nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if\nchanges were made.

BMC Medicine (2020) 18:124\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01597-8\nBackground\nOver 1.8 million cases and over 110,000 deaths from\nCOVID-19 have been recorded worldwide as of 13 April\n2020 [1]. A major route of transmission of SARS-CoV2\nis via droplet spread which requires close contact [2]. In\nan attempt to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, many\ncountries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies [3]. On March 23, with just over 6000 confirmed cases, the UK Government implemented strict\nphysical distancing measures instructing individuals to\nstay at home and avoid leaving their house except for essential work, to take one form of exercise a day, and to\nbuy essential items such as food and medicines. This\nfollowed the closure of sporting events, schools, restaurants, bars, gyms, and other leisure or hospitality-related\nbusinesses the previous week [4] and an increase in social distancing among the population that had been taking place for several days before the announcement [5].\nPhysical distancing interventions attempt to reduce\ncontacts relevant to infectious disease spread between\nindividuals. Multiple surveys have been instigated on the\nuptake of different physical distancing measures during\nthis current pandemic, but these have not explicitly measured contacts between people [6–8]. To make accurate\npredictions on the impact of these measures, quantitative data on relevant contact patterns is required [9–12].\nMany governments have adopted physical distancing\nmeasures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear to what extent these measures reduce the number of contacts and therefore\ntransmission. Only one previous survey—conducted in\ntwo Chinese cities, Wuhan and Shanghai, in February\n2020—quantified the impact of these measures on individuals’ contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic [13].\nChanges in human contact behaviour drive respiratory\ninfection rates. Understanding these changes at different\nstages of the COVID-19 pandemic allows us to rapidly\nquantify the impact of physical distancing measures on\nthe transmission of pathogens. In this paper, we describe\na survey of contact patterns and compliance with physical distance measures and present results from a sample\nof adults in the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (the\naverage number of secondary cases generated per case).\nMethods\nEthics statement\nParticipation in this opt-in study was voluntary, and all\nanalyses were carried out on anonymised data. The\nstudy was approved by the ethics committee of the\nLondon School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine reference number 21795.\nSurvey methodology\nWe commissioned the market research company Ipsos\nto conduct a survey of UK adults (referred to here as the\nCoMix survey). Adults (≥ 18 years) were recruited into\nthe survey by sending email invitations to existing members of their online panel. Representativeness of the general UK population was ensured by setting quotas on\nage, gender, geographical location, and socioeconomic\nstatus. This cohort of individuals will be requested to answer the survey every 2 weeks for a total of 16 weeks to\ntrack changes in their self-reported behaviour. The first\nsurveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a\nlockdown was announced for the UK.\nParticipants were asked about their attitudes towards\nCOVID-19 and the effect of physical distancing interventions, whether they or any of their household members experienced any recent symptoms, whether they\nwere tested for COVID-19, whether they had had any\ncontact with known COVID-19 cases, and whether they\nwere affected by physical distancing measures.\nParticipants reported (i) if any person in their household were advised to quarantine, isolate, or limit time in\ntheir workplace or educational facility in the preceding\n7 days due to COVID-19 and (ii) if they heeded the advice and isolated, quarantined, or stayed away from their\nworkplace or educational facility. In the survey, we defined quarantine as limiting contacts and staying at\nhome, with restricted allowance for movement outside\nthe home after a potential exposure with a COVID-19\ncase. We defined isolation as completely separating from\nuninfected contacts, including household members, either in the home or in a health facility. To assess the impact of advice and policy changes regarding physical\ndistancing, we asked participants to indicate if they had\nplanned to participate in a set of events in the preceding\nweek. For each event type, they reported (i) whether they\nproceeded with their plan, or (ii) if it was cancelled or\nthey decided not to go, and (iii) the frequency of the\nevent type in the previous 7 days. Additional questions\nwere asked about preventive behaviours, such as handwashing or wearing masks, and about the use of public\ntransport in the previous 7 days.\nIn addition, we asked participants to record all direct\ncontacts made between 5 am the day preceding the survey and 5 am the day of the survey. A direct contact was\ndefined as anyone who was met in person and with\nwhom at least a few words were exchanged, or anyone\nwith whom the participants had any sort of skin-to-skin\ncontact. We were unable to ask parents to provide contact information for their children due to lack of ethical\napproval; however, participants were able to list contacts\nwho were under 18.\nFor every recorded contact, participants documented\nthe age and gender of the contact, relationship to the\nJarvis et al. BMC Medicine (2020) 18:124 Page 2 of 10\ncontact, the frequency with which they usually contact this\nperson, whether contact was physical (skin to skin) or not,\nand the setting where the contact occurred (e.g. at home,\nwork, school, or whilst undertaking leisure activities), including whether contact occurred in- or outside an\nenclosed building. Questions on social contacts were consistent with those from the UK arm of the POLYMOD\nsurvey [14], which was used as the baseline pre-pandemic\ncomparison dataset. Details on survey methodology, the\nstudy protocol, and a copy of the questionnaire used are\nprovided in Additional files 1 and 2.\nStatistical analysis\nR version 3.6.3 was used for all analyses; the code and\ndata are available on github (see the “Availability of data\nand materials” section) [15–17].\nWe grouped study participants and contacts into the\nfollowing age bands: 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–\n69, and 70+. Age, gender, and locations of participants\nwere compared to the 2018 mid-year estimates provided\nby the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) to assess\nthe representativeness of the study sample [18]. We descriptively analysed answers related to symptoms, attitudes, exposure to physical distancing measures, and\nindividual preventative measures. We present the number and percentage or mean and standard deviation\nwhere appropriate (Table 3).\nWe calculated the average number of social contacts\nper person per day overall, and stratified by age category,\nsex, household size, location of contact, type of contact,\nand day of the week. We then compared the mean total\nnumber of daily contacts by age group to POLYMOD\nstratified by contact location.\nWe calculated social contact matrices for the agespecific daily frequency of direct social contacts, adjusting for the age distribution in the study population and\nreciprocity of contacts, using the socialmixr package in\nR [19].\nAs children (< 18 years) were not included as survey\nparticipants, we imputed contacts for younger age\ngroups (child-child and child-adult contacts) using the\nPOLYMOD UK data. Specifically, for those child contact\ngroups that were missing, we used a scaled version of\nthe POLYMOD social contact matrix. Following previous methods developed by Klepac et al. [20], as the scaling factor, we took the ratio of the dominant eigenvalues\nof the POLYMOD and CoMix matrices, for all age\ngroups present in both studies, stratified by setting. Furthermore, to reflect school closures during the collection\nof our survey, we removed school contacts from the\nPOLYMOD data from our analysis.\nThe basic reproduction number, or R0, is the average\nnumber of secondary infections arising from a typical\nsingle infection in a completely susceptible population\nand can be estimated as the dominant eigenvalue of the\nnext generation matrix [21]. The exact form of the next\ngeneration matrix is model dependent. For respiratory\ninfections, such as SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing\nCOVID-19), this is usually a function of the age-specific\nnumber of daily contacts, the probability that a single\ncontact leads to transmission, and the total duration of\ninfectiousness. Therefore, R0 is proportional to the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrix [19].\nWe assumed that contact patterns prior to physical\ndistancing were similar to those observed in the POLYMOD data and that the duration of infectiousness and\nthe probability that a single contact leads to transmission did not change during the study period. We also assume that all age groups contribute equally to\ntransmission. Under these assumptions, the relative reduction in R0 is equivalent to the reduction in the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrices. By multiplying\nthe value of R0 prior to the interventions by the ratio of\nthe dominant eigenvalues from the POLYMOD and\nCoMix contact matrices, we were able to calculate R0\nunder the physical distancing interventions. Prior to interventions, we assumed R0 followed a normal distribution with mean 2.6 and standard deviation of 0.54 based\non a meta-analysis of the literature presented in Additional file 3 [22–34].\nTo assess uncertainty, we repeated the age imputation\nprocess by taking 10,000 bootstrapped samples from\nboth POLYMOD and CoMix matrices. For every bootstrap sample, we calculated the ratio between the dominant eigenvalues for the sampled POLYMOD and\nCoMix matrices. This sampling provided a distribution\nof relative change in R0 from the contact patterns observed in POLYMOD and CoMix. Subsequently, we\nscaled the initial distribution of R0 with the distribution\nof bootstrap samples to estimate R0 under physical distancing interventions.\nRecent results of the BBC Pandemic study [20] suggested a decrease of nearly 50% in the average number\nof contacts made by teenagers (13–18 years) compared\nwith the POLYMOD data. We assessed the sensitivity of\nour results to a potential reduction in contacts over time\nby taking a conservative reduction of 50% between 5 and\n18 year olds in the POLYMOD study and repeating our\napproach to estimate the reduction in R0.\nResults\nParticipant characteristics\nWe surveyed 1356 UK participants who recorded 3849\ncontacts. The average age of participants was 47.2 years\n(standard deviation (SD) = 15, max = 86), and 45% (608/\n1356) were female (see Table 1). The average household\nsize was 2.8 (SD = 1.4, max = 10). Data were collected between Tuesday 24 and Friday 27 March 2020 inclusive.\nJarvis et al. BMC Medicine (2020) 18:124 Page 3 of 10\nParticipants were recruited from across the UK. The\nsample included participants from London (16.5%),\nNorth of England (16.0%), Midlands and East of England\n(26.5%), South of England (24.4%), Wales (4.4%),\nScotland (9.8%), and Northern Ireland (2.6%), whilst 116\nparticipants did not report their region (Table 1). Further details of participant demographics and the average\nnumber of contacts stratified by age, gender, household\nsize, and location are presented in Table 2. Compared to\nthe mid-year ONS population estimates taken from\n2018, individuals over 70 years and individuals between\nthe ages of 20–29 years were undersampled.\nThirteen participants reported having been tested for\nCOVID-19 with seven testing positive, and two participants still waiting for their results. Forty-one participants\nstated they had been in contact with a known COVID19 case. In terms of perceived risk, 26.4% (359/1356)\nthought that it was likely that they would develop coronavirus and 48.0% (652/1356) agreed or strongly agreed\nthat COVID-19 would be a serious disease for them if\nthey acquired the infection.\nImpact of physical distancing measures\nParticipants reported data on a total of 3824 household\nmembers, including themselves, of whom 508 (13.2%) had\nbeen asked to quarantine and 826 (21.6%) had been asked to\nisolate. Nearly a quarter (921; 24.1%) of household members\nlived in a house with someone who had at least one symptom of fever, aches, shortness of breath, or cough. Roughly\n50% of the 2122 employed individuals had either been asked\nto limit their time at work, had their work closed, and/or did\nnot visit their work in the preceding 7 days (Table 3). Of\nthose household members who attend educational establishments, 67.2% (818/1217) had their institution closed with\n63.3% not visiting during the previous 7 days.\nThere were clear suggestions that physical distancing\nin the previous week had impacted planned activities for\nsurvey participants with 51.3% of participants that\nintended to go to a concert being unable as the event\nwas cancelled, 40.6% intending to go to the cinema were\nunable as the cinema was closed, and 32.5% of participants having to cancel plans to visit a pub (Table 3).\nContrastingly, only a small percentage of participants\nTable 1 Participant characteristics in the CoMix survey, and comparison with 2018 mid-year UK population estimates provided by\nthe Office of National Statistics.

Figure 2 displays the average number of contacts\nacross age groups for all, physical, home, work, school,\nand other contacts. The matrices are consistent with the\nmajority of contacts being in the home, with work, and\nother contributing very little to the overall number of\ncontacts.\nEstimated the basic reproduction number of COVID-19\nunder physical distancing\nWe estimated the current R0 under physical distancing\nmeasures to be 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–\n0.89) based on all types of contact (Fig. 1). Based on\nphysical contacts only, we estimated R0 to be 0.37 (95%\nCI = 0.21–0.52). The average pre- to post-intervention ratio\nin R0 was 0.24 (min = 0.21, max = 0.27) for all contacts and\n0.14 (min = 0.12, max = 0.17) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. Based on these values, the physical distancing\nmeasures would have reduced the mean estimate of R0 to\nbelow one even if the initial R0 had been as high as 3.6 assuming all contacts are equally risky or 4.2 assuming only\nphysical contacts result in transmission.\nIn a sensitivity analysis, reducing contacts made by 5–17\nyear olds by 50% made little difference to the results. Under\nthis assumption, the estimated value of R0 for all contacts\nwould be 0.69 (95% CI 0.42–0.98) and 0.37 (95% CI 0.22–\n0.53) if physical contacts alone result in transmission.\nDiscussion\nThe measures introduced by the UK Government appear\nto have high levels of uptake among participants and\nFig. 1 Comparison of CoMix and POLYMOD contact matrices and estimated reduction in reproduction number due to physical distancing for all\nand physical (skin to skin) contacts separately. a Social contact matrices showing the average total number of daily reported contacts made by\nparticipants in different age groups with individuals in other age groups, with results shown for all contacts reported in the CoMix and POLYMOD\ndata. Participants’ contacts in CoMix for age groups 0–4 and 5–17 are imputed using the POLYMOD data. b The estimated value of R0 at the time\nof the survey, assuming values of R0 ~ Norm (2.6, SD = 0.54) prior to physical distancing reducing all contacts for all and physical (skin to\nskin) contacts\nJarvis et al. BMC Medicine (2020) 18:124 Page 6 of 10\nhave resulted in very large (74%) reductions in the total\nnumber of contacts. If similar changes are observed\nacross the UK population, we would expect the basic\nreproduction number to now be below 1 (0.62; 95% CI\n0.37–0.89) and that these physical distancing measures\nwill lead to a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not result in\nan immediate decline in reported cases, as there are significant delays between infection and the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further\ndelays to these events being reported. Hence, routine\nsurveillance data are unlikely to show a decline in cases\nfor some time. However, by directly measuring individuals’ contact patterns and estimating the corresponding\nbasic reproduction number, we are able to rapidly quantify the impact of physical distancing on transmission.\nThe total number of daily contacts (mean of 2.8 per\nperson) was significantly reduced compared to patterns\npreviously estimated in the POLYMOD study (10.7; excluding children < 18 years old) and more recently by\nthe BBC Pandemic study (10.5; excluding under 13 year\nolds) [20]. The observed reduction appears to be unlikely\ndue to chance given the large difference in average contacts and is consistent with a recent study conducted in\nWuhan, China, that estimated a reduction in the average\nnumber contacts per day from 14.6 prior to the outbreak\nto 2.0 under physical distancing interventions [13].\nWhilst we are unaware of any directly comparable data\nfrom the UK, our findings are certainly consistent with\nother reports from the UK of a dramatic reduction in social contacts, with, for example, only half of respondents\nin one survey reporting having left the house at all in\nthe past 24 h [5].\nThere are several limitations to this survey. Asking individuals to report their contacts from the day before\nmay result in recall bias. Moreover, individuals who are\nadhering to physical distancing measures may have been\nmore likely to respond to this survey, potentially resulting in selection bias and in an overestimate of the impact of these measures. The POLYMOD survey used\npaper-based diaries whereas CoMix utilises an online\nform, which may have resulted in different numbers of\ncontacts being reported in CoMix. However, it is unlikely that the large differences observed would be due\nonly to the reporting methodology of the surveys. Furthermore, we were not able to sample any children, so\nchild-child contacts had to be imputed from the POLYMOD survey. This weakens the comparability of the two\nstudies, and future work is planned to directly measure\nchild-child contacts which will help assess the impact of\nthis limitation.\nWe were not able to quantify any additional effect\nfrom the interventions on transmission, such as reduction in infectiousness by increased handwashing. In\naddition, we were not able to calculate the net reproductive number, R, as we did not account for the proportion of the population that is no longer susceptible.\nThese could all reduce the net reproductive number to\nFig. 2 Contact matrices for all reported contacts made in different settings, comparing CoMix to POLYMOD\nJarvis et al. BMC Medicine (2020) 18:124 Page 7 of 10\nvalues lower than estimated in our analysis. This approach further assumes that all age groups contribute\nequally to transmission, which may not be the case. Assuming flu-like transmission where children are the\ngroup most responsible for transmission, the contribution of adults to overall R0 would be lower [9]. However,\nif children do not play a significant role in transmission,\nthe significance of adult transmission will be higher.\nTherefore, although this survey provides evidence of\noverall contacts in the population reducing which will\nconsiderably lower R0, lack of knowledge of the relative\ncontributions of different age groups to overall transmission reduces our ability to precisely determine the exact\nreduction in transmission.\nOur analysis assumed that direct contacts are an appropriate proxy for effective contacts, and thus, that\ntransmissibility is equal across age groups (e.g. contact\nbetween a single infected child and susceptible adult is\nas likely to result in transmission as contact between a\nsingle infected adult and a susceptible adult). We further\nassume that the reduction in non-school contacts in\nchildren is similar to that observed in adults. Furthermore, we assume that the contact patterns prior to interventions are consistent and of similar magnitude. A\nrecent study has found significantly lower numbers of\ncontacts reported by teenagers compared with the\nPOLYMOD survey [20]. Decreasing mixing among 5–\n17 years by 50%, whilst reducing the magnitude of reduction in R0, did not affect the qualitative conclusions\nfrom the analysis.\nAs of 13 April, the growth rate of reported cases in the\nUK appears to be slowing, declining from a 20% increase\nper day for the 5 days prior to 24 March to a 7% increase per day for the 5 days prior to 13 April [1]. This\nis consistent with a reduction in the reproduction number; however, it is difficult to correlate the magnitude of\nthis reduction with the estimated value of R0. Our approach assumes that individuals within an age group behave the same, and does not account for hospitals and\nother institutions which will have different disease dynamics. Moreover, due to the UK testing algorithm being focused on people in hospitals and as there seems to\nbe an increasing problem of nosocomial infection, any\ndecline in community infection may be counterbalanced\nby an increase in nosocomial infections. Given that the\nconfirmed cases are primarily hospital based, this can\nhave a disproportionate effect on the estimated\nreproduction number using crude data (i.e. not split by\nroute of transmission). Future work is planned to compare the estimates of R0 with the growth rate of the epidemic, accounting for changes in levels of testing,\nreporting, delays, and transmission context.\nThis study is planned to continue in the UK for the\nnext 15 weeks and will be extended to other countries\nincluding Belgium and the Netherlands. Future analyses\nwill be able to explore changes in contact patterns during different interventions and may provide early warning signs of changes in contact patterns due to\ninterventions being lifted or decreasing adherence with\nrestrictions.\nConclusions\nWe have shown that behavioural monitoring can give a\nrapid insight into transmission of COVID-19 and have\nprovided the first evidence that the restrictions adopted\nby the UK Government have led to a decrease in transmission of COVID-19.\nTable 3 shows compliances with different social distancing measures due to COVID-19.

The clinical spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2 infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening and fatal disease. Current estimates are that approximately 20 million people globally have “recovered”; however, clinicians are observing and reading reports of patients with persistent severe symptoms and even substantial end-organ dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because COVID-19 is a new disease, much about the clinical course remains uncertain—in particular, the possible long-term health consequences, if any.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nCurrently, there is no consensus definition of postacute COVID-19. Based on the COVID Symptom Study, in which more than 4 million people in the US, UK and Sweden have entered their symptoms after a COVID-19 diagnosis, postacute COVID-19 is defined as the presence of symptoms extending beyond 3 weeks from the initial onset of symptoms and chronic COVID-19 as extending beyond 12 weeks.1 It is possible that individuals with symptoms were more likely to participate in this study than those without them.\n\nPreviously described, a postacute syndrome is well recognized in patients who are recovering from a serious illness, in particular an illness that required hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit. In a 2016 study among 43 patients who had been discharged after intensive care unit stay (46% required mechanical ventilation), 36 (84%) reported impairment in cognition, mental health, or physical function that persisted for 6 to 12 months beyond hospital discharge, collectively known as post–intensive care syndrome.2 In a study from Italy that assessed COVID-19 symptom persistence among 143 patients discharged from the hospital, only 18 patients (12.6%) were completely free of any COVID-19–related symptoms after a mean of 60 days after initial symptom onset.3\n\nHowever, postacute COVID-19 syndrome is not just observed among patients who had severe illness and were hospitalized. In a telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention among a random sample of 292 adults (≥18 years) who had a positive outpatient test result for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, 35% of 274 symptomatic respondents reported not having returned to their usual state of health 2 weeks or more after testing, including 26% among those aged 18-34 years (n = 85), 32% among those aged 35-49 years (n = 96), and 47% among those aged 50 years or older (n = 89).4 Older than 50 years and the presence of 3 or more chronic medical conditions were associated with not returning to usual health within 14 to 21 days after receiving a positive test result. Notwithstanding, 1 in 5 individuals aged 18-34 years without chronic medical conditions had not yet achieved baseline health when interviewed at a median of 16 days from the testing date.\n\nManifestations\n\nThe most commonly reported symptoms after acute COVID-19 are fatigue and dyspnea. Other common symptoms include joint pain and chest pain.3 In addition to these general symptoms, specific organ dysfunction has been reported, involving primarily the heart, lungs, and brain. From a pathogenesis standpoint, these complications could be the consequence of direct tissue invasion by the virus (possibly mediated by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor), profound inflammation and cytokine storm, related immune system damage, the hypercoagulable state described in association with severe COVID-19, or a combination of these factors.\n\nCardiovascular\n\nMyocardial injury, as defined by an increased troponin level, has been described in patients with severe acute COVID-19, along with thromboembolic disease. Myocardial inflammation and myocarditis, as well as cardiac arrhythmias, have been described after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a German study of 100 patients who recently recovered from COVID-19, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (performed a median of 71 days after COVID-19 diagnosis) revealed cardiac involvement in 78% and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60%.5 The presence of chronic comorbidities, duration and severity of acute COVID-19 illness, and time since original diagnosis did not correlate with these findings. However, the sample was not random and likely biased toward patients with cardiac findings. Nevertheless, among 26 competitive college athletes who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, none of whom required hospitalization and the majority without reported symptoms, 12 (46%) had evidence of myocarditis or prior myocardial injury by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging routinely performed for positive testing results (range, 12-53 days later).6 The durability and consequences of such imaging findings are not yet known and longer follow-up is needed. However, an increased incidence of heart failure as a major sequela of COVID-19 is of concern, with considerable potential implications for the general population of older adults with multimorbidity, as well as for younger previously healthy patients, including athletes.\n\nPulmonary\n\nIn a study of 55 patients with COVID-19, at 3 months after discharge, 35 (64%) had persistent symptoms and 39 (71%) had radiologic abnormalities consistent with pulmonary dysfunction such as interstitial thickening and evidence of fibrosis.7 Three months after discharge, 25% of patients had decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. In another study of 57 patients, abnormalities in pulmonary function test results obtained 30 days after discharge, including decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and diminished respiratory muscle strength, were common and occurred in 30 patients (53%) and 28 patients (49%), respectively.8 If compounded on cardiovascular comorbidity, either preexisting or incident from COVID-19, persistent decline in lung function could have major adverse cardiopulmonary consequences.\n\nNeurologic\n\nSARS-CoV-2 can penetrate brain tissue via viremia and also by direct invasion of the olfactory nerve, leading to anosmia. To date, the most common long-term neurologic symptoms after COVID-19 are headache, vertigo, and chemosensory dysfunction (eg, anosmia and ageusia). Although stroke is a serious albeit uncommon consequence of acute COVID-19, encephalitis, seizures, and other conditions such as major mood swings and “brain fog” have been reported up to 2 to 3 months after initial illness onset.9 Past pandemics involving viral pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS], and influenza) have involved neuropsychiatric sequelae that could linger for months in “recovered” patients, which can seriously threaten cognitive health, overall well-being, and day-to-day functional status.\n\nEmotional Health and Well-being\n\nIn addition to symptom persistence and clinical sequelae that may last far beyond the initial COVID-19 illness, the extent of emotional and behavioral concerns and general distress for those affected has yet to be determined. A diagnosis of COVID-19, and subsequent need for physical distancing, has been associated with feelings of isolation and loneliness.10 COVID-19–related stigma has also become pervasive and can result in a sense of hopelessness. Increasing reports of lingering malaise and exhaustion akin to chronic fatigue syndrome may leave patients with physical debility and emotional disturbance. Compounded by the psychological toll of the pandemic experienced population wide, individuals recovering from COVID-19 may be at even greater risk of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder. These combined effects have the potential to result in a global health crisis, considering the sheer number of COVID-19 cases worldwide.\n\nConclusions\n\nGranted that no long-term data of substantial numbers of patients with various presenting symptoms exist and with comparison groups, and that it is still early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that large numbers of patients will experience long-term sequelae. Outpatient post–COVID-19 clinics are opening in many localities where large outbreaks have occurred, and the term “long-haulers” has been suggested to refer to these patients. It is imperative that the care of this vulnerable patient population take a multidisciplinary approach, with a thoughtfully integrated research agenda, to avoid health system fragmentation and to allow the comprehensive study of long-term health consequences of COVID-19 on multiple organ systems and overall health and well-being. Furthermore, such an approach will provide the opportunity to efficiently and systematically conduct studies of therapeutic interventions to mitigate the adverse physical and mental health effects among hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who recover from COVID-19. Longer-ranging longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials will be critical to elucidate the durability and depth of health consequences attributable to COVID-19 and how these may compare with other serious illnesses.\n\nBack to topArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Carlos del Rio, MD, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, 49 Jesse Hill Jr Dr SE, FOB Room 201, Atlanta, GA 30303 (cdelrio@emory.edu).\n\nPublished Online: October 5, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.19719\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.",

Using segmented linear regression, we estimated the extent to which relaxation of social distancing affected epidemic control, as indicated by the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (Rt).\n\nResults\nIn the 8 weeks prior to relaxation, mean Rt declined by 0.012 units per day (95% confidence interval [CI], −.013 to −.012), and 46/51 jurisdictions achieved Rt < 1.0 by the date of relaxation. After relaxation of social distancing, Rt reversed course and began increasing by 0.007 units per day (95% CI, .006–.007), reaching a mean Rt of 1.16. Eight weeks later, the mean Rt was 1.16 and only 9/51 jurisdictions were maintaining an Rt < 1.0. Parallel models showed similar reversals in the growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Indicators often used to motivate relaxation at the time of relaxation (eg, test positivity rate <5%) predicted greater postrelaxation epidemic growth.\n\nConclusions\nWe detected an immediate and significant reversal in SARS-CoV-2 epidemic suppression after relaxation of social distancing measures across the United States. Premature relaxation of social distancing measures undermined the country’s ability to control the disease burden associated with COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, basic reproductive number, public health regulations, social distancing\nTopic: district of columbiareproductive physiological processstate governmentepidemicsepidemic controllinear regressionsars-cov-2covid-19jurisdiction\nIssue Section: Major Articles\nThe United States is home to the largest epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally, having surpassed 7 million reported cases and 200 000 deaths by late September [1]. The burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the United States has been disproportionately and inequitably borne by Black, Latin, and American Indian populations [2]. After experiencing large, localized epidemics in March and April, all 50 US states and the District of Columbia implemented social distancing measures, with inadequate social protection [3], in an attempt to interrupt transmission and reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Several studies from the United States [4–7] and elsewhere [4, 8, 9] have demonstrated the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing COVID-19 case growth and the resulting morbidity and mortality, although the effectiveness of these behavioral responses has been conditioned by income [10].\n\nConcerns about adverse economic, population health, and social spillover consequences of social distancing [11–15] have undermined adherence to social distancing guidelines and prompted efforts to relax these restrictions [16–18]. Beginning in late April, state governments and the District of Columbia began relaxing the social distancing measures that had, up to that point, successfully slowed the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [5]. Relaxation of such measures is intended to be accompanied by appropriate behavioral practices (eg, mask wearing and physical distancing) and control measures (eg, contact tracing and increased availability of testing), so that epidemic control can be maintained [19–26].\n\nHowever, there has not been a coherent national strategy to promote appropriate behavioral practices, nor has an effective control infrastructure been coordinated at the federal level. As a result, recent decisions about relaxing social distancing measures have been challenged, and the burden of reopening is disproportionately borne by racialized minority populations [27]. Critical unanswered questions remain about if and how relaxation of social distancing measures can be carried out while effectively maintaining epidemic control. To address this gap in the literature, we abstracted state-level data on the implementation and relaxation of social distancing measures and undertook a longitudinal pretest-posttest comparison group study to determine the extent to which relaxation of social distancing measures has led to a recrudescence in COVID-19 transmission in the United States.\n\nMETHODS\nThe unit of analysis was each US state (or the District of Columbia). We identified all statewide social distancing measures that were implemented and/or relaxed between 10 March and 15 July 2020, triangulating data from state government and third-party sources [5] (see Supplementary Appendix for full details of the search procedures). Our primary explanatory variable of interest was time in days, which we divided into 2 time periods relative to the first date of relaxation of social distancing measures: (a) The prerelaxation observation period began on the date social distancing measures were first implemented in the state. For states where social distancing measures were implemented early in the epidemic, the prerelaxation period was specified as beginning 56 days prior to the date any of the social distancing measures were first relaxed in the state. We selected this 8-week threshold to ensure that all jurisdictions had a roughly similar amount of observation time during the period prior to relaxation of social distancing measures. (b) The postrelaxation observation period began the day after any of the social distancing measures were first relaxed and extended through to 9 July 2020. For states where any statewide social distancing measure was reimposed prior to 9 July, the postrelaxation period was specified as ending on the date any statewide social distancing measure was reimposed. Analysis was restricted to days on which a state had at least 100 cumulative cases reported, to minimize any effects of volatile rate changes early in the epidemic [28].\n\nWe then summarized state-specific patterns of implementation and relaxation of statewide social distancing measures. To determine the extent to which states were able to maintain epidemic control after relaxation of social distancing, we used segmented linear regression: we fitted mixed-effects linear regression models, specifying the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (Rt) as our outcome of interest, and a random effect by jurisdiction to account for within-state differences in behavior, policies, or epidemic reporting. Rt corresponds to the expected number of secondary infections generated by each index case [29]. We selected Rt (using a Bayesian semimechanistic model of the infection cycle, as estimated by Unwin et al [30]) as our primary outcome to avoid reliance on crude case detection, which is susceptible to biases resulting from differential testing availability and delays in result reporting, both of which are known to be problematic in the United States [31, 32]. In contrast to reported cases, the methods described by Unwin et al [30] estimate disease transmission patterns based on observed SARS-CoV-2-related deaths [8] and thus partially mitigate bias due to testing and reporting patterns. The Rt value for a given day reflects the secondary cases generated by individuals infected on that day. The primary explanatory variables of interest were time in days, relaxation period, a time-by-relaxation-period product term. We also adjusted for day of the week [33] and state-level population density (estimated from 2018 US population data).\n\nWe conducted a number of sensitivity analyses to probe the robustness of our findings and to further explore patterns of epidemic transmission after measures were relaxed (see Supplementary Appendix for a full description of all sensitivity and secondary analyses). In brief, these analyses included (1) stratifying analyses by the type of measures first relaxed; (2) examining days since relaxation of shelter-in-place orders (ie, restrictions on internal movement) as the primary explanatory variable of interest; (3) using an alternate method of measuring Rt as derived by Abbott et al [34]; (4) using the method of generalizing estimating equations in lieu of a linear mixed effects model; (5) varying the prerelaxation time period to account for state-level patterns; (6) specifying log change in cases and log change in deaths as our outcome of interest while accounting for incubation periods and times to death after infection [35–37]; and (7) investigating epidemic size (ie, cases, deaths, and zenith Rt) and epidemic indicators (current Rt and the test positive rate [38]) to assess the extent to which they might drive differences in COVID-19 recrudescence after relaxation of social distancing.\n\nRESULTS\nBetween 19 March and 7 April 2020, all 51 jurisdictions implemented at least 1 social distancing measure, and most (45 [88%]) implemented a statewide restriction on internal movement (Supplementary Table 1). A median of 47 days after social distancing measures were first implemented (interquartile range [IQR], 41–53), between 20 April and 1 June 2020, all 51 jurisdictions relaxed at least one statewide social distancing measure (Supplementary Figure 1). The median number of cumulative cases per state on the date of relaxation was 7883 (IQR, 3160–23 650). The median number of cumulative COVID-19-attributable deaths per state on the date of first relaxation was 272 (IQR, 113–1056). There was variation in which social distancing measures were initially relaxed. Easing of work restrictions was the most common element of initial relaxation orders in 40 (78%) jurisdictions, followed by reopening of service industry establishments (32 [63%]), reopening outdoor recreational facilities (22 [43%]), rescission of statewide restrictions on internal movement (16 [31%]), and sanctioning of public events (14 [27%]). Only 4 states (8%) reopened public schools, and none rescinded mandatory quarantines for interstate travel, as part of their initial relaxation orders.\n\nFigure 1 displays a scatterplot of the estimated Rt for each state by day, before versus after the first social distancing measures were relaxed, along with a smoothed line derived from locally weighted scatterplot smoothing. During the 8 weeks prior to the first date in each state that social distancing measures were initially relaxed, the estimated Rt declined by an average of 0.012 per day (95% confidence interval [CI], −.013 to −.012) (Table 1). This period corresponded with a decline from a modeled mean Rt across all states of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.41–1.48) to .75 (95% CI, .72–.78). After the first social distancing measures were relaxed, the estimated Rt reversed course and began increasing by an average of .019 per day (95% CI, .018–.020) compared with the prerelaxation period, such that the mean increase in Rt in the postrelaxation period was .007 units per day (95% CI, .006–.007), and reached a mean of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.13–1.18) by 56 days after relaxation. If these trends were to continue, the estimated mean Rt would cross 1.50 by approximately 16 weeks after relaxation.\n\nFigure 1.\nScatterplot of the estimated Rt for each state by day before and after the first date of relaxation of social distancing measures, along with a smoothed line derived from locally weighted scatterplot smoothing.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nScatterplot of the estimated Rt for each state by day before and after the first date of relaxation of social distancing measures, along with a smoothed line derived from locally weighted scatterplot smoothing.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.Mixed Effects Linear Regression Models for the Estimated Rt Before Versus After Relaxation of Social Distancing Measures\nCoefficienta\t95% Confidence Interval\tP value\nConstant term (day prior to relaxation) \t.761 \t.728, .793 \t<.001 \nPrerelaxation period (days relative to relaxation) \t−.012 \t−.013, −.012 \t<.001 \nPostrelaxation period intercept \t.032 \t.010, .054 \t.005 \nTime × postrelaxation period (days relative to relaxation) \t.019 \t.018, .020 \t<.001 \nPostrelaxation period (days relative to relaxation)b \t.007 \t.006, .007 \t<.001 \naEstimates adjusted for day of the week and population density.\n\nbThe postrelaxation term represents the linear combination of the prerelaxation period and the time × postrelaxation period coefficient.\n\nOpen in new tab\nResults were qualitatively similar irrespective of the nature of the first social distancing measures relaxed (Table 2).

When we redefined the primary explanatory variable of interest as the period before versus after rescission of statewide restrictions on internal movement, the estimated Rt declined by an average of .004 per day (95% CI, −.005 to −.004) in the prerelaxation period. After statewide restrictions on internal movement were lifted, the estimated Rt reversed course and began increasing by an average of .013 per day (95% CI, .011–.014) compared with the prerelaxation period. The estimated regression coefficient on the time-by-post-relaxation period product term was attenuated in magnitude, and slightly attenuated in statistical significance, when we used the Rt estimates based on the daily number of infections and an uncertain generation time, as calculated by Abbott et al [34]. The generalized estimating equations specification changed little. Finally, our results remained similar after varying the duration of the prerelaxation period from 14 to 42 days, with a downward slope in the prerelaxation period as we shorted its duration but with persistently significant reversals in the postrelaxation period. When we specified log change in cases and log changes in deaths as the primary outcome of interest, we similarly found a strongly significant conversion from a downward slope to a flattening of the growth rate, corresponding to a consistent rate of increase in cases and deaths.\n\nState-specific trajectories of Rt during the pre- and post-relaxation periods are depicted in Figure 2. Forty-four (86%) jurisdictions successfully established a mean downward trajectory in Rt in the prerelaxation period and nearly all (46 [90%])—save Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Wisconsin—achieved an Rt < 1.0, by the time they begun relaxing social distancing measures. However, only 4 states (8%) maintained a negative trend in Rt after relaxation of social distancing: Alaska, New York, South Dakota, and Tennessee. Nine jurisdictions (18%) maintained an Rt < 1.0 at 8 weeks following relaxation: Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Vermont.\n\nFigure 2.\nState-specific scatterplots of the estimated Rt by day, before vs after the first date that social distancing measures were relaxed, along with a smoothed line derived from locally weighted scatterplot smoothing.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nState-specific scatterplots of the estimated Rt by day, before vs after the first date that social distancing measures were relaxed, along with a smoothed line derived from locally weighted scatterplot smoothing.\n\n\nWhen we modeled Rt in the postrelaxation period to identify correlates of epidemic control after relaxation, we found that states with a lower number of cases and deaths at the time of relaxation, and a lower zenith Rt in the prerelaxation period, had slightly greater increases in the daily Rt during the postrelaxation period compared with jurisdictions in which the epidemic was more severe prior to or at the time of initial relaxation (Supplementary Table 3). Only 9 states (18%) states had achieved a 14-day test-positive rate of <5% at the time of relaxation. Both Rt < 0.9 and a test positive rate <5% on the date of relaxation correlated with greater epidemic growth after relaxation (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figure 2).\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn this national study observing the COVID-19 epidemic during the period April—July 2020 in the United States, we found that relaxation of statewide social distancing measures was associated with a reversal of the downward trend in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that had been achieved after these measures were implemented. In all but 9 states, the reversal returned the estimated Rt back above 1.0 within 8 weeks of the initial relaxation of social distancing measures—leading to increased transmission, an increased number of cases, and an increased number of deaths. These patterns were apparent irrespective of the specific kinds of social distancing measures that were rescinded and also irrespective of key indicators of epidemic severity (eg, test positivity rate) that have been heretofore used by many jurisdictions to guide relaxation decisions [38]. Our findings, in combination with prior data noting the strong and significant effect on epidemic interruption after implementation of measures [4–9], should motivate policy makers to reconsider the rapid pace at which states are reopening their economies. Furthermore, in the states that are currently experiencing a recrudescence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, strong consideration should be given to the reimposition of social distancing measures—in the setting of appropriate social protection measures—so that new infections of COVID-19 do not overwhelm the local healthcare system. Intermittent social distancing regulations may be necessary to control the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States until more effective treatments or an effective vaccine become available and achieve widespread dissemination in the population [25].\n\nLittle data exist to inform the US exit strategy from its current state of social distancing measures. The city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China, was the first to enter a regime of strict social distancing (beginning 23 January 2020), but the relaxation of these measures has not resulted in a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission [39]. Within 2 months, the Chinese government was able to achieve the milestone of having 5 consecutive days in which there were no new locally transmitted cases in the country [40]. Modeling studies, however, suggest that stringent social distancing should have been maintained for longer than the median duration observed in the United States and that social distancing should have been leveraged as a strategy for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 transmission so that additional nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, contact tracing and increased availability of testing) could be deployed [19–25]. Moreover, deconfinement should have occurred gradually and, in the setting of contiguously connected jurisdictions (eg, countries in Europe or states in the US), should have been coordinated across jurisdictions to maximize the probability of successful deconfinement [41].\n\nWe found that states with more severe epidemics at the time social distancing measures were relaxed had reduced postrelaxation epidemic growth, compared with states that had experienced smaller epidemics. These differences were small in magnitude but precisely estimated. This finding suggests that individuals living in states with large epidemics might be more likely to maintain social distancing even after local orders are formally lifted. These results are in keeping with data from survey respondents in New York City and Los Angeles during the peak of their epidemics, who showed near unanimous support for such measures in locations that had suffered severe epidemics [42]. There may be other phenomena underlying this finding, each of which may have partial explanatory power, such as the possibility that a strong local response could have improved trust in scientists and government [43] or that people living in these states would have been more likely to adhere to social distancing guidelines even if their state governments had not, contrary to fact, implemented statewide social distancing measures [16, 18, 44, 45].\n\nWe also explored whether epidemic indicators can be used to guide reopening. One such indicator, recommended by the World Health Organization [38] and multiple US states, is a test positive rate <5% over the previous 14 days. Although only a handful of states met this recommended threshold at the time their social distancing measures were first relaxed, those that did unexpectedly experienced a greater increase in epidemic transmission following relaxation. Similarly, states with a lower Rt at the time of relaxation saw a faster subsequent increase. In summary, in the United States there appeared to be a paradoxical inverse correlation between indicators of epidemic control at the time social distancing measures were relaxed and subsequent trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Indeed, these data might suggest that if people interpret state government-ordered relaxation of social distancing measures as a signal that the local epidemic is under control and, as a result, disregard social distancing practices that are not otherwise mandated (eg, mask wearing and physical distancing), a counterintuitive worsening of the local epidemic might follow the rescission of state-ordered social distancing measures [46].\n\nThe primary limitation of our analysis is the potential for confounding by phenomena that may have occurred simultaneously with relaxation of social distancing measures and that also influenced the trajectories of Rt. For example, if a social movement supportive of a reopening agenda [47] advocates for relaxation of state-mandated social distancing measures and independently influences nonmandated social distancing behaviors [16, 18], our estimates of the effect of rescission on epidemic control would be biased away from the null. However, we found similar effect sizes and time-specific reversal in Rt trends across most states, irrespective of political and demographic characteristics. Moreover, because relaxation of social distancing measures took place across a wide range of dates, such potentially confounding factors would have had to have occurred independently across multiple states and coincided with relaxation of multiple state measures.\n\nNotwithstanding this potential limitation, our findings suggest that suppression of SARS-CoV-2 after rescission of statewide social distancing measures has failed. Robust surveillance programs are needed so that, should the observed trends continue, state and local public health policy makers can continuously evaluate the stringency of social distancing measures required to prevent subsequent epidemic surges [19–26] while minimizing the extent of social and economic harms [11–15, 48]. Considering the current projected timelines for vaccine development [49], the low levels of cumulative population infection even in countries that have experienced severe epidemics [50, 51], and the disproportionate manner in which the burden of reopening has been shouldered by racialized minority populations [27], thoughtful public health leadership will be needed to ensure that COVID-19-attributed mortality and intersecting harms are maximally prevented [3].\n\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression and insomnia in the general population and among healthcare professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis, it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTopic: anxietydepressive disordersfearmental disordersmental healthsocial isolationsurvivorseconomicslonelinessstresssuicideinsomniamoodsuicidal behaviorsubstance use disordersolder adultpandemicssocial mediacovid-19coronavirus pandemic\nIssue Section: Review\nCoronavirus disease pandemic\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began at the end of 2019 in China and has quickly spread globally.1 Millions of people around the world are infected and hundreds of thousands have died.1 The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary from asymptomatic forms to severe clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure, sepsis, septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes.1 Understandably, medical professionals and public health specialists are focused on taking care of individuals who are very sick, while containing the coronavirus’s spread in the general population. Less attention is given to the psychiatric consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nMultiple lines of evidence indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has profound psychological and social effects.1,2 There is a pervasive awareness of uncertainty over the future and an understanding that the pandemic is far from over. It is possible that there will be economic privation and political upheaval. The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. In this article, I suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and suicide rates during and after the pandemic.\n\nPrevious epidemics and suicide\nNothing in our lifetimes can be compared with the magnitude of the COVID-19 disaster. The last comparable crisis was the pandemic of Spanish Flu in 1918–19 caused by H1N1 viruses with genes of avian origin.3 About 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population were infected with the Spanish Flu viruses and at least 50 million people perished around the world including about 675 000 in the USA.3 The Spanish Flu epidemic was associated with an increase in death by suicide.4 It has been proposed that a decrease in social integration and interaction during the epidemic and the fears caused by the epidemic likely increased suicide.4 It is important to note that social isolation and fears are common during the current COVID-19 epidemic.2\n\nThere was a significant increase in suicide deaths among people aged 65 and over during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong.5 Research indicates that this increase in suicides can be attributed to fears of contracting the illness, fears of being a burden to the family, general anxiety, social isolation and psychological distress.\n\nThe psychological impact of COVID-19\nA number of studies have been performed to examine the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental health of the general population, health care professionals and individuals with psychiatric disorders.6–16 Wang et al.6 examined psychological responses during the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in the general population in China. The authors found that 53.8% of 1210 respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe, 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms and 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Qiu et al.7 performed a countrywide survey that included 52 730 people in China during the COVID-19 epidemic and found that about 35% of the participants had psychological distress. This is consistent with the results of a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey indicating that 45% of adults in the USA report that their mental health has been negatively impacted due to worry and stress over the coronavirus.8\n\nLi et al.9 analyzed online posts made by 17 865 Chinese social media customers before and after the declaration of COVID-19 in China on 20 January 2020. The authors observed that negative emotions including anxiety, depression and anger rose, whereas the positive emotions and life satisfaction diminished. Xiao et al.10 studied a relationship between social capital as measured by the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 and sleep characteristics in person who were isolated during the COVID-19 epidemic. Researchers observed that anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. Xiao et al.10 wrote that ‘anxiety and stress of isolated individuals were at high levels, whereas the sleep quality was low.’\n\nAhmed et al.11 did an online survey of 1074 Chinese people and found elevated rates of anxiety, depression, harmful alcohol use and decrease in mental wellbeing.11 Rates of anxiety and depression were higher among young people aged 21–40 years in comparison to other age groups. Huang and Zhao12 conducted a web-based survey of 7236 individuals in China. The overall prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep abnormalities were 35.1%, 20.1% and 18.2%, respectively. This study also showed that health care professionals were more likely to have poor sleep quality in comparison to other occupational groups.\n\nLai et al.13 examined a state of mental health of 1257 health care professionals in China. 50.4% of study participants reported depression, 44.6% anxiety, 34.0% insomnia and 71.5% distress. Frontline health care professionals who were taking care of patients with COVID had a higher risk of having symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress in comparison to other medical professionals. In March 2020, Ahmed et al.14 did an online study to examine anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists. The authors received responses from 669 dentists from 30 countries. An overwhelming majority of study participants reported anxiety and fear of contagion. Some dentists closed their practices for an indefinite period of time.\n\nHao et al.15 compared the psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on individuals with or without mood and anxiety disorders. Worries about their physical health, anger, impulsivity and suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than in healthy controls.\n\nProbably, alcohol consumption increases during the COVID-19 crisis.2,16 According to a market research firm Nielsen, US sales of alcoholic beverages rose 55% in the week ending 21 March 2020 compared with the same period last year.16 Online alcohol sales jumped 243%.\n\nMultiple cases of COVID-19-related suicides in the USA, UK, Italy, Germany, Bangladesh, India and other countries have been reported in mass media and psychiatric literature.17–22 For example, a 19-year-old waitress in England died in a hospital after a suicide attempt because of fears of the ‘mental health impacts’ of isolation.17 A 66-year-old man with throat cancer hanged himself in a New York City hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus.18 A man in Illinois who feared that he and his girlfriend contracted the coronavirus fatally shot his girlfriend and then killed himself.19 They tested negative for the coronavirus. A 36-year-old Bangladeshi man killed himself because he and people in his village thought that he was infected with COVID-19 because he had fever and cold symptoms.20 A postmortem examination showed that he did not have COVID-19. The 49-year-old head of the Emergency Department in a New York City hospital died by suicide after telling her family about the tremendous suffering and death she witnessed while taking care of coronavirus patients.21 Also, there is a huge increase of calls to suicide prevention hotlines in the USA during the current COVID-19 epidemic.22\n\nIn summary, studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression and insomnia in the general population. Health care professionals are especially distressed.\n\nSuicidal behavior in the COVID-19 era\nSocial isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of stress-related disorders and suicidality in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, low-resilient persons, individuals who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas and people who have a family member or a friend who has died of COVID-19 (Figure 1).23,24 Individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders include not only patients who are treated by mental health professionals but also a very large number of people with psychiatric conditions who do not receive psychiatric treatment.25,26 For example, an international study that included the data from countries in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australia showed that the median untreated rates for schizophrenia, major depression and alcohol use disorder were 32.2%, 56.3% and 78.1%, respectively.25 Community epidemiological research in the USA shows that a majority of individuals with mood disorders are either untreated or undertreated.26\n\nFigure 1.\nSuicidal behavior in vulnerable populations in the COVID-19 era. \nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSuicidal behavior in vulnerable populations in the COVID-19 era.\n\n\nSocial isolation contributes to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior.5,27–30 In his famous book on suicide, Durkheim27 emphasized that social connectedness is a critical factor in emotional health and social stability. The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing as well as other research investigations demonstrated that social isolation and loneliness are associated with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder.28,29 Studies have shown that both objective social isolation (e.g. living alone) and subjective sense of being alone are associated with suicidal ideation and behavior.29 These observations are consistent across diverse cultures and populations. For example, the Quebec Health Survey showed that living alone and having no friends were associated with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.30 Social disengagement played a role in the increased suicide rate during the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong.5 One-third of SARS-related suicide victims experienced social isolation during the SARS outbreak. From a suicide prevention perspective, it is troubling that the most important public health approach for the COVID-19 epidemic is social distancing.\n\nAnxiety and fear of contagion during the COVID-19 crisis may be related to uncertainty, fear of unknown and panic-inducing stories in traditional and social media.2,23 Repeated exposure to reports about the COVID crisis can intensify anxiety. Worries and fears cause various mental and physical symptoms and may lead to the development of anxiety disorders, depression and sleep disorders.24 Studies suggest that the relationships between insomnia and depression and insomnia and anxiety are bidirectional.31 Sleeplessness contributes to symptoms of depression and anxiety and contrariwise, symptoms of depression and anxiety disturb sleep. Sleep disturbances are a stand-alone risk factor for suicidal behavior.32\n\nUncertainty, especially economic uncertainty is associated with stress-related disorders and suicide.2,23,33,34 It has been shown that uncertainty is a more stressful state to be in than really knowing something bad will happen.35 Uncertainty is associated with depression and anxiety.33 In one research investigation, daily suicide data from England and Wales were matched to a daily economic policy uncertainty index over the period 2001–15.34 The authors found that a spike in daily economic uncertainty lead to an immediate impact on suicides which suggest that economic uncertainty may lead to an increase in the risk of suicide.\n\nThe impact of economic problems related to the COVID-19 crisis on mental health may be severe. Millions of people around the world lost their jobs.1,2,23 Measures required to contain the virus, including self-isolation by workers and consumers, shutting of plants and stores and prohibitions on sports and entertainment events are detrimental for economy. Historically, economic downturns were associated with mental health disorders and suicides.36–39 Studies observed that increases in the unemployment rate were associated with higher prevalence of depression, alcohol and other substance use disorders and suicide deaths.36 Both perceived job insecurity and unemployment constitute significant risks of increased depressive symptoms in prospective observational studies.37 In the USA, suicides increased during the Great Depression.38 Suicide mortality peaked with unemployment, in the most recessionary years, 1921, 1932 and 1938.38 Suicide rates also increased in other countries during the Great Depression. For example, Varnik39 reported a rise in suicide death in Estonia in the early 1930s. Reeves et al.40 observed that almost all European countries have experienced rising suicide rates during the 2008–10 recession. The authors estimated that, in total, there were at least 10 000 more economic suicides during the recession in the European Union, Canada and the USA than would have been expected. Economic decline during and after the COVID-19 pandemic will probably have a powerful and harmful effect on mental health and result in an increase in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. It is important to note that financial problems may reduce access to psychiatric treatment.\n\nThere is a high probability that the COVID-19 survivors especially survivors who had severe COVID-19 are at elevated suicide risk.41 Stressful experiences such as learning about the diagnosis of COVID-19, fear of infecting others, symptoms of the illness, hospitalization, especially admission to an intensive care unit, and loss of income may lead to the development of anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder.41,42 A recent study in China indicated that 96.2% of recovering COVID-19 patients had significant posttraumatic stress symptoms.43 Around 50% of recovered patients remained anxious after the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong.44 COVID-19 infection is associated with neurological conditions including acute ischemic stroke, headache, dizziness, ataxia and seizures.45 A recent review of the impact of the COVID on the brain show that neurological conditions are present in about 25% of the COVID-19 patients.45 Many recovering COVID patients have physical symptoms including pain for a long time.46 Neurological disorders such as ischemic stroke, headache and seizures are associated with suicidal behavior.47 Physical symptoms, especially pain also increase suicide risk.24,48\n\nPsychiatric conditions including mood, anxiety, sleep and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior.24 Studies in the USA suggest that >90% of suicide victims have a psychiatric disorder.24,49 For example, depression is a major risk factor for suicide, accounting for up to 60% of suicide deaths.49 Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic.\n\nThere is a high probability that suicide rates will increase in many countries of the world. This problem may be especially difficult in the US. Suicide rates have been steadily growing in the USA over the last two decades.50 From 1999 through 2017, the age-adjusted suicide rate in the USA grew 33% from 10.5 to 14.0 per 100 000.50 For women, the rate grew 53% from 4.0 in 1999 to 6.1 in 2017. For men, the rate grew 26% from 17.8 in 1999 to 22.4 in 2017. If suicide rates increase in the USA, it will add to the trend of rising national rates of suicide. An increase in suicide rates may become a significant public health issue in other countries.\n\nSuicide prevention in the COVID-19 era\nIn 1994, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) Committee on Prevention of Mental Disorders suggested that prevention of psychiatric conditions should be divided into three categories: universal preventive interventions, selective preventive interventions and indicated preventive interventions.51,52 Suicide prevention efforts during the COVID-19 crisis can also classified as either universal, selective or indicated.\n\nA universal approach is designed for everyone in the general population regardless of their risk for suicide.52 To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. People need to be encouraged to stay connected and maintain relationships by telephone or video, get enough sleep, eat healthy food and exercise. It is vital to deliver community support for those living alone and to encourage families and friends to check in. Screenings for anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings ought to be employed. Transparent, timely and responsible media reporting is absolutely necessary. Community or organizational gatekeepers including clergy, first responders, pharmacists, geriatric caregivers and school employees may have an opportunity to identify individuals at risk for suicide and direct them to proper evaluation and treatment. Suicide prevention helplines should be available and may be very useful in preventing suicides. Integration of basic mental health services into outpatient primary care may help to minimize the harmful psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis. Whenever possible, governments and non-governmental organizations should provide financial support for people in needs. This may include direct cash payments, postponement of loan repayments, tax credits etc.\n\nA selective approach is for subgroups at increased risk for suicide, for example, for individuals with a history of psychiatric disorders, persons with symptoms of significant emotional distress, COVID-19 survivors, frontline health care professionals and elderly people.52 Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors and older adults. People with psychiatric disorders should be advised to continue their treatment regimens and to stay in touch with their mental health professionals. Some psychiatric patients may need adjustments in their treatment and increased frequency of contact with their mental health clinicians. Telemedicine can improve accessibility of mental health care. Also, vulnerable individuals should be advised to limit watching, reading or listening to traditional and social media news stories.\n\nAn indicated approach is designed for individuals who have a risk factor or condition that puts them at very high risk for suicide, e.g. a recent suicide attempt.52 Individuals in suicidal crises need special attention. Some suicidal persons might not seek help because of fear that attending face-to-face appointments with a health care professional might put them at risk of contracting COVID-19 or because of other reasons. Therefore, individuals with a recent suicide attempt history need a follow-up. Clinicians should have well-defined guidelines on how to deal with suicidal individuals.\n\nSuicide prevention in the COVID-19 era is an important and difficult issue. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It is to be hoped that the efforts of clinicians, researchers and policy makers will reduce COVID-19 related suicides.\n\nConflict of interest. None declared",

This paper targets to analyse this socio-economic impact to determine how the pandemic is causing various problems to the impoverished. An integrative literature review was carried out to sample the consequences of the global pandemic economic crisis on the poor communities in four different continents. The research points out how it is hard on the poor to adhere to the restrictive measures of social isolation or the lockdown. Immediate strategies that minimize the pandemic impact on the livelihood and the socio-economic activities of the poor are suggested. The research opens future research about more specialised programs for the poor during any future lockdowns.

Introduction The emergence of the current global pandemic, Covid-19, has  so  far  been  a  threat  to  the  worldwide  community. COVID-19 or novel coronavirus is a variant of the corona family of viruses  which causes  SARS on the  people they infect. The virus is chiefly transmitted through coughing or sneezing on people. With  the lack of any suitable vaccine, most  governments  have  imposed  lockdowns  to  curb  the growth of the virus.  Several countries have adopted aggressive health policies and geared their resources to the reality of this global health emergency,  based  on  the  experiences  of  countries  that suffered the early attacks of this zoonotic fierce-full virus.  However, many slow developing countries and new   * Corresponding author: buhejim@gmail.com (Mohamed Buheji) Published online at http://journal.sapub.org/economics Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

This even is becoming difficult with the unstable global economy, which  is  estimated  to  contract by  2.8%  in  2020.  Such  a depression on a  global scale  means a  decrease of  -12.5% within the third quarter. This scenario is even more severe in emerging economies, where the economic recovery will be even slower in economies. (Innes McFee, 2020). One  of  the  consequences  of  this  global  economic depression will be seen in the increase in pressure on prices, which will recover in mid-2022. As projections, the increase in the world unemployment rate will reach a mark of more than 10% at the end of 2020 in return for 5.2% seen in 2019. In this sense, regardless of its socio-economic situation, each country needs to take measures that would balance between the demand for health safety and the livelihood requirements of its people.  Sumner  et  al.  (2020)  confirmed  in  the  UN  study  that global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990. This  means  that  COVID  poses  a  real  threat  to  the  UN Sustainable Development Goal  (SDGs) for ending poverty by 2030. Through calculating the contractions per capita of \n214  Mohamed Buheji et al.:    The Extent of COVID-19 Pandemic Socio-Economic   Impact on Global Poverty. A Global Integrative Multidisciplinary Review  household income  or consumption,  Sumner team  set three scenarios: low, medium, and high global decreases of 5, 10, and 20 per cent; for the three international poverty lines of US$1.90, US$3.20 and US$5.50 per day.  According to one estimate, 1.4 billion people are trapped in extreme poverty and reside in developing countries (IFAD, 2011).  This  estimate  includes  many  countries  in  Africa, which have a large population of people out of poverty. In some  regions,  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic could  return the  poverty levels  similar to  those recorded 30 years ago. Under the most extreme scenario of a 20 per cent income or consumption contraction, the number of people living in poverty could more increase by 420–580 million,  relative to  the  latest official  recorded  figures for 2018. Sumner et al. (2020) Although the pandemic has created different local realities between the various countries and continents of the world, they  are still  one common  worry and  question: How  the COVID-19 mitigation restrictive  measures are  creating an impact  on  the  poor  communities  around  the  world, regardless of their country? In this global multi-disciplinary holistic review, we shall explore such impact from different perspectives. The  World  Bank  defines  poverty  as  \"an  inability  to achieve a  minimum standard  of living\"  (2018). Consist of this fact, today more people around the world are losing the various dimensions for a minimum standard of living. The breakout of the Covid-19 is only speeding it. This  is quite clear in countries where there are a high number of people without  a  formal  contract,  or  depending  on  day  to  day self-employment.  These  are the  people  that  would  suffer most in this pandemic, especially when the world continues to  be  forced  to  apply  force  social  distancing  through quarantines, lockdown and curfew. World Bank (2018). In  this  paper,  we  call  for  considering  and  striking  a balance  between  the  social,  the economic  and  the  health strategies in the next new normal, in order to minimize the famine, the hunger, the starvation and the depth of poverty in many regions of the world. In this sense, the present holistic review evaluates the socio-economic effects of the Covid-19 protective measures and what possible alternatives for poor communities.  2. Literature Review 2.1. Understanding the Phenomenon of Poverty Latvia  (1998)  believes  that  poverty  is  a  status  of humiliation, a sense of being dependent on the others, and of being  forced to  accept  rudeness, insults,  and indifference when one seeks help.  In the simplest sense poverty can be defined as simply “the state of being poor”. Varying international institutions have differing views on this matter. Sometimes such definitions are the impetus behind legal  mechanisms. United Nations   in  a  General  Assembly  session  once  defined  poverty  as “fundamentally  poverty  is  a  denial  of  choices  and opportunities,  a  violation  of  human dignity”.  The  United Nations sees poverty as the “state of deprivation reflected in the low consumption of food and low health conditions and educational level and lack of  access to it and low housing conditions”. UN (2020). Thus, poverty as phenomena means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It is beyond not having enough to feed and clothe a family, but goes to the scarcity of having access to school or clinic, scarcity of land on which to grow  one’s  food,  or  a  job  to  earn  one’s  living,  or  even scarcity  to  access  support  or  credit.  It  means  insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities.  Being  poor  means,  one  would  have  the susceptibility to violence and would be living on marginal or fragile  environments,  without  access  to  clean  water  or sanitation.  In a simple sense, we can say that poverty as phenomena deprive people from  the right to enjoy basic necessities of life. And this phenomenon can come as relative poverty or the notion  of the  inability to  meet minimum  standards of living,  and  differs  to  each  economical  and  geographical context. We  can’t  say  that  someone from the impoverished section of society in the West and Scandinavian countries is equally poor  compared to  the impoverished section  of the societies in South Asian countries.  The second category  of poverty phenomena is  absolute poverty or the complete lack of means necessary to maintain personal socio-economic needs, such as food, clothing and shelter.  Here  the  meaning  doesn’t  change  according  to context. Some nations are perpetually in the state of abject poverty. Some of the reasons can be a fragile economic plan, dictatorship, colonised past and many other things.  Understanding the  poverty revolves  around  ‘income’  is significant for emergency lockdowns such as the ones that happened  by  the COVID-19  pandemic.  Here  the lack  of income is a crucial factor in determining all the subsequent harm.  Having  less  purchasing  power  can  often  leave impoverished  people  at  the  raw  end  of  all  political commitments,  a  lot  of  time  the  impoverished  are unsurprisingly  hit  the  hardest  by  natural  and  induced phenomena like famine, diseases, war, riots, etc.  Most  analysis  of  poverty  still  focuses  on  numerical monetary  parameters,  establishing  demarcation  lines  that define the poor and the indigent (Moura et al., 2014). These measures allow the comparison between and within societies, however, they are hardly able to deal with the complexity of the phenomenon, which involves situations that go beyond the simple absence of money (Cidade et al., 2012; Moura et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 2017). Recently, scholars of the phenomenon have used synthetic indexes to help in a broader understanding of the condition of poverty  from different  perspectives that  what  are usually published  by  international  organisations  like  the  United Nations, the World Bank, and the World Economic Forum. Among the important research that brought new indices is the work of Barros et al. (2006). This Brazilian study set 48 indicators organized in six dimensions, namely: vulnerability, \n  American Journal of Economics 2020, 10(4): 213-224  215   scarcity  of  access  to  knowledge,  scarcity  of  access  to   work,  scarcity of  resources,  development of  children and homelessness. However, most  analyses of  poverty still are  constrained with  the numerical  monetary parameters;  therefore, many researchers  called  for  establishing  demarcation  lines  that define  the  poor  and  indigent  (Moura  et  al.,  2014).  For example,  in  Brazil,  there  is  no  official  demarcation  line       of  poverty,  the  country  still  has  different  measures  for definition of the poor (Oliveira et al., 2017).  With the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, the world needs  more  measures  that  address  the  complexity  of  the poverty  phenomenon,  and  goes  beyond  the  comparison between one community to another, and certainly beyond the simple absence of money (Buheji and Ahmed, 2019; Silva  et al., 2017; Moura et al. 2014 Cidade et al., 2012). 2.2. Multidimensional Poverty and the Challenges of COVID-19 Pandemic What  makes  COVID-19 pandemic  very  unique human experience is that due it is for the first time that the world has collectively experienced such a mass disease transmission in the modern era, where technology has vastly improved since the last 100 years. With the speed of spread of the deadly COVID-19  disease  and  the  slow  reach  of  vaccination, inflation  of  food  and  deterioration  of  other  related livelihoods  would  push many  people towards  famine and starvation,  besides  the  spread  of  corruption,  crime  and terrorist power expansion are highly expected. This would enhance absolute, and relative poverty all over the world and specifically the efforts to end illiteracy and low education are going to be affected (Ahmed and Buheji, 2018). There  are  three  main  types  of  poverty  that  would  be affected by  the  challenge of  COVID-19. Relative  poverty would be the most affected type  of poverty.  Many middle classes  would  feel  the  punch  of  the  deterioration  of  the socio-economic living standard compared to what they used to access freely. The income inequality would increase due to the  total instability. The absolute  poverty is the second affected type of poverty where many would come just under the line of poverty due to the amount of unemployment and difficulty of finding full-time jobs. The  least affected type would the extreme poverty where the percentage of people who have a scarcity of  essential food,  clean water, health shelter, education and information would approximately stay the same. Understanding  of  poverty  as  a  multidimensional phenomenon, marked by multiple aspects, not controlled by economic factors  only, is  fundamental when  we deal with life freezing pandemic. Poverty extends to level and quality of  education,  occupation  and  health.  This  understanding would help us to visualize the magnitude of the impacts of the crisis and extent of the impact that this pandemic carry.  Whiles  the  developed  and  rich  developing  countries experiencing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and how it deprived them of many qualities of life practices, one should remember those who have been deprived of life necessities all  their  life,  where  poverty  is  causing  for  them multi-disability for them and their family. The worries now are that COVID-19 mitigation measures are going to lead to further deprivation of minimal survival and life necessities needs. This deficiency might expand from deprivation due to insufficient income, to lack of income. (Buheji, 2019). While poverty is a relative concept that changes from time to place, we might be faced with the perpetuation of poverty over  time.  Therefore, sometimes,  the poor  are  considered merely as the one who cannot find the strength of his day and night  (Schilbach  et  al.,  2016).  However,  it  is  worth  to mention that all the types of poverty, in reality, participate in creating failure in the capacity of the poor to manage their assets  or  autonomously  develop  their  condition  (Buheji, 2019a). Today with the internet and social media availability one could see a disturbing trend about how people from poorer backgrounds  are  held  responsible  and  vilified  by  more privileged people of the society for problems they don’t have the power to solve during the nationwide lockdown in India. On  this  basis  of  Social,  Health,  Economic  and  Social aspects,  there  are different  ways  to identify  the  types of poverty. First, there is the financial poverty, where the poor might have the asset, but not the cash flow. Second to this type of poverty is physical poverty, where people would look poor, or have a health condition that carries the symptoms of indigence as malnutrition (Buheji, 2019b). 2.3. Status of Poverty in the World Before COVID-19  2.3.1. Case of Asia (Focus on India as an Example) Since  the  COVID-19  declared  a  pandemic,  Indian Government,  knowing  the  very  fragile  situation  of  its healthcare  system,  invoked  the  Epidemic  Diseases  Act,   1897  and consequently  educational institutions  and  many commercial establishments were shut down. India was one of the first countries in the global arena to have shut down its borders  to  prevent  the  transmission  of the  virus  through international  passengers.  On  March  22,  2020,  PMOI Narendra Modi requested a 14-hour self-imposed lockdown. It was  followed soon by nationwide lockdown which  was initially  about to  be  lifted by  14 April,  but  inadvertently pushed till 3rd May due to the gravity of the situation. The Oxford  COVID-19  Government  Tracker  published  in  its report based on data from 73 countries that India topped the list on acting more stringently than other countries.  From the second lockdown, certain relaxations took place including  permitting  listed  economic  activities  in  ‘green zones’ or places which are at a very low risk of COVID-19. At the time of writing, the COVID-19 curve in India looks   to be  going in  the right  direction as  the doubling  rate had slowed  to  a  very  large  extent  from  the  point  when  the lockdown  started. What  remains a  question  is how  India would  respond  to  the  impending  issues  on  the  poorer sections of the society. Deccanherald (2020) \n216  Mohamed Buheji et al.:    The Extent of COVID-19 Pandemic Socio-Economic   Impact on Global Poverty. A Global Integrative Multidisciplinary Review  India has been a hotspot of the huge informal sector. 90% of the working population in India still works in the informal sector;  a  sizeable  portion  includes  rickshawalas,  migrant labourers, landless agricultural labourers, etc. Working at the informal sector comes with a fair share of problems. There’s no job security, no sick leave, no paid leave, all in all, puts the  employee  under  very  bad  conditions.  The  Economic Times (2020). 2.3.2. Case of Africa (Focus on Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya as Examples) With  coronavirus  diseases,  many  developing  countries and  especially in  the  African continent  are  going  to face long-term  consequences,  World  Bank  (2020).  The COVID-19 pandemic is a real threat to all type of livelihood for  all over  the world,  but it  is most  devastating  when it would carry further deterioration to those mostly on living below any economic, social, health and educational services.  The world's poorest continent may experience the greatest economic loss in recent years, as some governments fail to provide  aid  to  their  people  during  the  pandemic.  It  is necessary  for  health  professionals,  governments  and policymakers to  recognize the  seriousness of  the possible socio-economic consequences.  The World Bank (2000) describes poverty as hunger, lack of shelter, being sick and not being able to see a doctor, not having access to school and not knowing how to read, not having a job, fearing the future, and living one day at a time. Statistics show that till today, the majority of Africans fit this description. Besides 70% or more, today lives on less than $2.50 a day compared to almost half of the world, while 80% of all humans live on less than $10 a day. However, one has to add that  these poverty factors  are based mainly on  the capital-based economy.  Africa  also has  the  repeated factor  of  poverty that  has stayed  in  this  continent  since  human  history  that  is  the internal  and  external  human-made  conflicts  (Newell  and Simon,  1972).  With  the  presence  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, this repeated factor would bring in more death and misery to those barely surviving communities.  The colonization of Africans in many years of slavery and the lack of technology and industry knowledge has been a major cause of sustained poverty in this region of the world. Besides  the  ineffective  leadership  and  poor  governance, bribery and corruption, and lack of vision and foresight have also caused the current situation of poverty in Africa.  According to the World  Bank, the percentage of people living below $ 1.90 a day in sub-Saharan  Africa fell from 54.3% in  1990 to  41.0% in  2013, although the  number of people  living  below  the  international  poverty  line  has increased from 276 million in 1990 to 388.7 million people in 2013 (Anyanwu and Anyanwu, 2017). About 82% of the poor  population  live  in rural  areas,  earning  mainly from agriculture, rural poverty is notably greater in areas with high agricultural opportunities. In  Africa  still  have  many  conditions  of  malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, squalid surrounding, high infant mortality, and low life expectancy. A disease like the COVID-19 would increase such conditions further. Deepa et al. (1999) collected in a book the voices of the poor and  how  they  feel about  poverty. A  poor man  from Kenya  (1997) when  says  “Don’t  ask  me  what  poverty  is because you have met it outside my house. Look at the house and count the number of holes. Look at my utensils and the clothes that I am wearing. Look at everything and write what you see. What you see is poverty”. 2.3.3. Case of South America (Focus on Brazil as an Example) Before  the  coronavirus  pandemic,  Latin  American countries,  such  as  Brazil  and  Argentina,  already  faced political  and  economic  crises  in  their  territories,  which manifested themselves  mainly  in the  lives of  the poorest. According to data from the World Bank (2017), despite the economic growth experienced by the Brazilian people in the last  decade,  Brazil's  historical  debt  to  the  most  fragile population  keeps  the  nation  in  a  condition  of  poverty. Poverty is its main characteristic, structural condition, which marks the  unequal relations of income distribution  among the population (Oliveira et al., 2017; Silva et al., 2017). According to official information, in 2016, approximately 52 million people  lived in  Brazil in conditions of poverty, and  13.3  million  lived  in  conditions  of  extreme  poverty (IBGEa, 2017). With regard to inequality, currently, 1% of the Brazilian population enjoys 28% of the wealth available in the country (World Bank, 2017). The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, 2020), shown  regardless of  the pandemic,  in recent  years Brazil  has  already  been  experiencing  a  strong  economic crisis due to the political crisis it has undergone, marked by measures of the devaluation of public services, relaxation of labour laws, loss of rights and consequently layoffs, which favoured an increase in unemployment. In evolutionary terms, World  Bank data  reveal that  the proportion of poor people in Brazil grew from 25.7% in 2016 to 26.5% in 2017. Following this trend, the proportion  of children and adolescents from 0 to 14 years old who had the US $ 5.5 per day went from 42.9% to 43.4% in that period. In addition, South America, in general, failed to reduce the social inequality and the system clearly is working towards concentrating a large part of the wealth produced by the poor and the vulnerable. A similar example to Brazil in terms of social  austerity  policies  and  measures  can  be  seen  in Argentina.  The  significant  increase  in  poverty,  a  super devaluation of  the currency,  high unemployment rates  are worsening the poverty conditions.  2.3.4. Case of Europe (Focus on the EU Performance towards the Vulnerable as an Example) Europe has  been developing  since its  union. This  is the result of various input factors, that raised the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a result of technological development and \n  American Journal of Economics 2020, 10(4): 213-224  217   structural  transformations.  The  most  prevalent  economic activity in the history of Europe to date is Trade. Although the  European  continent  is  believed  to  be  among  the wealthiest  continents  in  the  World.  One  of  the  most discussed topics in the EU parliament is poverty reduction. The  2008  economic  crisis  created  a  spike  in the  rate  of poverty and  inequality in Europe, which  has already been considered as a major problem (Lecerf, 2016). The EU  (2010) defines poverty in a very different  way from  other world  definitions.  According to  the  European Union  (EU,  2011),  poverty  is  generally  understood  as relative poverty; a person or household is considered to be poor when their income and resources are lower than what is thought to be adequate or socially acceptable in the society (Council  of  Europe).  Despite  the  fact  that  European countries tend to refer to poverty as relative, there are people living in absolute poverty in Europe.  According to The World Health Organization report from 2009, 25%  of children  were living  in absolute  poverty in southeastern Europe. The rate of poverty or social exclusion reached  the  lowest  point  in  Europe  in  the  year  2005. However, in the year 2017, 113 million people, 22.4% of the EU population were at risk of poverty or  social exclusion. One in five people in the EU experienced at least one of the following three forms of poverty: monetary poverty, severe material  deprivation  or  very  low  work  intensity  of  their household (EUROSTAT, Europe 2020 indicators - poverty and social exclusion). The rate of poverty started to rise in the year 2009 caused by the 2008 economic crisis. More than 33 million people, 29.8% of all people at risk of poverty or social  exclusion  were  affected  by  one  or more  forms  of poverty at the same time; meanwhile 7 million people were affected  by  all three  forms  of  poverty  (European  Union, 2019). 2.4. Estimating the Global Poverty Status Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Estimating  how  much  global  poverty  will  increase because  of COVID-19  is challenging,  due to  the amount uncertainty that the next normal carries. Even if we try to do the estimation by using ‘general equilibrium models’ or by exploring  what  will  happen  if  all  countries’  growth  rates decline a fixed amount, the outputs won’t be accurate. Thus, this paper would use the World Bank approach of household survey  data  and  growth  projections  for  166  countries  to forecast the new normal poverty. (Daniel et al., 2020). In this regard, taking data from the latest year for which PovcalNet (an online tool provided by the World Bank for estimating global poverty) Daniel et al. (2020) has estimated poverty  for  a  country  and  extrapolate  forward  using  the growth  projections  from  the  recently  launched  World Economic  Outlook.  This  approach  assumes that  countries’ growth accrues equally to everyone, or in other words, that COVID-19 does not change inequality within countries.  COVID-19  pandemic  worsened  the  world  capacity  to eliminate poverty and returned it to the poverty alleviation stage.  Figure  (1)  show  the  differentiation  between  the expected  historical  line  of  poverty  elimination  and  the impact on this progress from the COVID-19.

The impact of COVID-19 on Global Poverty \n218  Mohamed Buheji et al.:    The Extent of COVID-19 Pandemic Socio-Economic   Impact on Global Poverty. A Global Integrative Multidisciplinary Review  With the new forecasts, Global Poverty- the share of the world’s  population  living  on  less  than  $1.90  per  day-  is projected to increase from 8.2% in 2019 to 8.6% in 2020 or from 632 million people to 665 million people. This means that  COVID-19 is  causing a  change in  2020  of a  Global Poverty rates of 0.7% points. This means that it is estimated that in the new normal, we should expect to see 49 million individuals  pushed  into  extreme  poverty in  2020  (Daniel   et al., 2020). COVID-19 crisis thus  requires a  dramatic expansion of social  safety  nets, specifically  in developing  countries, as soon as possible.  2.5. Socio-Economic Impacts of COVID-19 on the Poverty Communities  The  consensus  among  most  of  the  countries  that  the economic impact of  the COVID-19 can be shown through three  possible  scenarios,  the  labour  productivity  shock, major impacts  come from workers unable to do their job, resulting in an average decline in labour productivity of 1.4% during 2020.  The COVID-19  causes a total  factor productivity shock which  impacts  are  felt  through  a  temporary  paralysis           of  domestic  canonic  activity  caused  by  disruptions  to distribution channels, inability to provide inputs and services due to quarantine for workers and total factor  productivity growth big enough to reduce global GDP by 1%. The last is the trade shock. In  this case, the  impacts are  felt through international trade disruptions leading the cost of doing trade to increase by almost 5% on average and enough to provoke a global economic growth cost of 1% (Vos et al., 2020). 2.5.1. Asian Continent India is a true representation of many developing countries in  Asia,  where  lockdown  is  causing  for  them  other life-threatening situations.  Take,  for  example,  the migrant workers.  The  Central  government  informed  the  Supreme Court that among 5 to 6 hundred thousand migrant labourers had to arduously walk to reach their villages. Several of them either died from the exhaustion of the inhumane journey or had been  run over  by vehicles.  The plight of the workers vividly describes the divide between rural and urban India. Deccanherald (2020). Due  to  the  lack  of  employment,  safe  haven  and  food availability, the migrant workers needed to take the drastic measures to  return to  their villages.  Thousands have been stuck  at  numerous  railway  and  bus  stations  without transportation. In  one very  controversial instance,  migrant labourers were collected and sprayed disinfectant through a pipe  which  might’ve  caused  problems  to  their  immunity. HRW (2020). The majority of the poor families in Asia lives in the slums. Slums have migrant workers who undertake both short and long duration movements to cities to look for higher wages and  work  opportunities.  The  work  in  an  urban  informal economy is intermittent, marked by low-skill requirements, low wages, severe competition, and constant job insecurity. Choudhry and Avinandan (2020). Other categories at threat are the slums dwellers. India's  22%  population  lives  in  urban  slums,  which  are characterized  by acute  poverty,  over-crowding, unhealthy residing  conditions, and  a vulnerable  urban public  health setup. Concept of social distancing isn't always pragmatic in such conditions. One such example is the Dharavi slums of Mumbai. The third category who are at great challenge during the pandemic lockdown is the daily wage earners. This category is the worst affected population because of  the COVID-19 outbreak, due  to loss  of livelihood, they  might run  out of food.  Most  do  not  have  bank  accounts,  although  lots of people  are  benefitting  through  government  schemes. Although these schemes are not reaching every household, so in order to get their daily commodities they have to go out and face the beatings of the local police, as the police were instructed to follow strict rules during the lockdown. The fourth group you can see a lot in Asia and specifically India are the domestic helpers. Domestic work in India falls underneath the category of unregulated and informally paid work. Most of the home employees do no longer have any settlement  with  their employers.  This  leaves them  at  the mercy  of the  employer who  may choose  to  pay or  deny paying at some point of unpaid leave. Due to lockdown most of the  home helpers are out of  a job, accordingly without livelihood even to meet their basic needs.  Due  to  the  lockdown,  schools  which  supplied  the ‘mid-day meal’ remained close. This affected another group that  is  children  in  many  poverty  and  lower-middle-class communities  where  they  are  dependent  on  their  one ‘constant’  meal.  Due  to  the  lack  of  useful  resource  and proper  connectivity,  these  children  are  unable  to  study through online classes and are being deprived of their right to education. Chotiner (2020). The  last  group  of  importance  in  this  lockdown  is  the farmers. Due to the lockdown, demands in the market have decreased drastically. As an instance, in the state of Assam, has triggered problems for the farmers. 75% of Assam's 3.10 crore population  depends on  agriculture - making farming the  primary source  of  income for  its  residents.  The state produces tons  of kilograms of vegetables each  spring, but now has relied on restricted agricultural farming. A",

The UK extended restrictions on the movement of people; as did other countries when numbers of deaths continued to increase. Sweden in contrast has favoured ‘herd immunity’, having notably less restrictions on the population, but specific guidance to protect the most vulnerable. The scale of economic interventions too has differed. Initially measures such as statutory sick pay from the first day of absence were put in place to ensure people self-isolated immediately when displaying symptoms. Latterly economic measures served to mitigate the financial pressure on businesses and employees as countries went into lockdown. The size of fiscal input has been relatively large but varied within each country4 (see Table 1). The number of deaths and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expenditure however do not seem to be directly proportionate; e.g. New Zealand have spent 4% of their GDP with 21 deaths as of 20 May 2020, the USA spent 11% with 91 664 deaths,5 and Sweden (14.9% GDP) has recorded 3 831 deaths.6\n\nDiscussion\nMain finding of this study\nInternationally, there is clear intention from governments to protect its people and businesses amidst what is likely to be the biggest recession of our time. The strategies and scale of economic interventions have been broad, ranging from 2.5% to a reported 50% of Gross Domestic Product.\n\nGovernments have subsidised from 80%, 70% to 50% of an employee’s salary in the UK, France and the USA, respectively.7 This aims to temporarily protect businesses and jobs whilst affording people to pay for necessities. Governments are providing support on mortgage repayments; in Spain and Italy, mortgage payments are suspended for 6 and 12 months, respectively.8 Protection for businesses is provided through loans and grants.\n\nWhat is already known on this topic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is putting healthcare systems across the world under severe strain. Although COVID-19 is a mild to moderate febrile respiratory infection in most people, viral infection can trigger potentially fatal lung inflammation. We know that both COVID-19 and measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have disproportionately affected some populations groups including the elderly, ethnic minority groups, those with underlying health conditions and those on lower incomes.9\n\nWhat this study adds\nAs major economies pass the peak of infections fear of spiralling unemployment loom, KPMG, the global accountancy firm, estimates approximately 20 million job losses in the USA by the second quarter of 2020.10 Europe has responded to EU hardships by releasing billions of euros to ameliorate the situation.8 Japan injected a further 8.9 trillion yen ($82.6 billion) to cover the crisis.11 The UK estimates 12 million people could be unemployed in the next quarter.12 Political nervousness therefore seems justified.\n\nEstablishing strategies on restarting the economy must be balanced against the uncertainty of a possible second wave and overwhelming the healthcare system. Researchers highlight that saving lives through social distancing far outweighed economic damage. The analysis showed benefits outweighed the economic costs by $5.2 trillion.13 There is no trade-off between saving lives and livelihood.14 However, this next phase requires a more nuanced strategy taking into account not only immediate risk to life but longer-term risks of widening inequalities and falling life expectancy.\n\nNumerous countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions and restart economies in different ways. There is therefore evolving, real-world data. This intelligence should be used dynamically by governments. Leaders are recommended to strategise for the long game whilst building in agility to respond to international learnings. A disproportionate economic intervention package should be put in place to match the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on lower socioeconomic groups and ensure the opportunity of ‘levelling up’ is not lost. Dialogue and collaboration with business leaders and public and population representative bodies should inform the strategy, and this should be underpinned by investment in public health as restarting the economy in full depends on easily accessible testing and tracing, vaccination, treatment and care.\n\nLimitations of this study\nThis study is limited to publicly available information. The COVID-19 pandemic and countries’ responses are an evolving situation, and the information presented here was correct as of 24 May 2020.\n\nShaun Danielli, Mr\n\nRaman Patria, Mr\n\nPatrice Donnelly, Ms\n\nHutan Ashrafian, Dr\n\nAra Darzi, Lord Professor",

It has also sparked fears of an impending economic crisis and recession. Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions have lead to a reduced workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast, the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector is also facing increased demand due to panic-buying and stockpiling of food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy.\n\nKeywords: Economy, Economic impact, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus\nGo to:\n1. Introduction\nLabelled as a black swan event [1] and likened to the economic scene of World War Two [2], the outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2)) has had a detrimental effect on global healthcare systems with a ripple effect on every aspect of human life as we know it. Sohrabi et al. highlighted the extent of the outbreak with the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring the COVID-19 outbreak as a global emergency on January 30, 2020 [3]. In a response to ‘flatten the curve’ [4], governments have enforced border shutdowns, travel restrictions and quarantine [5,6] in countries which constitute the world's largest economies, sparking fears of an impending economic crisis and recession [7].In an attempt to understand the turmoil effect on the economy, we summarise the effect of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy, focusing on primary sectors which include industries involved in the extraction of raw materials, secondary sectors involved in the production of finished products and tertiary sectors including all service provision industries.\n\nGo to:\n2. Primary sectors\n2.1. Agriculture\nThe resilience of the agricultural sector has been tested by the COVID-19 outbreak. A global crash in demand from hotels and restaurants has seen prices of agricultural commodities drop by 20% [8]. Countries around the world have imposed a number of protective measures to contain the exponentially increasing spread. This includes social distancing, avoiding unnecessary travel, and a ban on congregations. Advice on self-isolation upon contact with suspected carriers of the virus is likely to impact the number of available inspectors and delivery staff critical to ensuring verification and transportation of products. This will have pronounced implications for perishable goods such as meat and vegetables. Furthermore, markets have gone a step further by shutting down floor trading which has impacted the ability to exchange commodities. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is a recent example [9]. ‘Panic buying’ is further complicating shortages beyond supermarket shelves. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) have expressed concern over low levels of animal pharmaceuticals from several large drug suppliers [10].\n\n2.2. Petroleum & oil\nDuring a meeting at the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna on March 6th, a refusal by Russia to slash oil production triggered Saudi Arabia to retaliate with extraordinary discounts to buyers and a threat to pump more crude [11]. Saudi, regarded as the de facto leader of OPEC, increased its provision of oil by 25% compared to February – taking production volume to an unprecedented level. This caused the steepest one-day price crash seen in nearly 30 years – On March 23rd, Brent Crude dropped by 24% from $34/barrel [12] to stand at $25.70 [13]. Although a deceleration in the number of COVID-related deaths has caused some stabilisation of oil prices, there is still much uncertainty.\n\nOn the background of a viral outbreak already dampening the demand for oil, this oil-price war is predicted to have grave implications for the global economy. In more ordinary times, cheap oil may have functioned as an advantage for economies. However, savings on petrol are unlikely to be redirected into more spending as populations are instructed to practise social distancing and the working class are uncertain about job security. Furthermore, any increase to consumer activity is likely to be outweighed by damage caused to populations reliant on revenue from other forms of energy such as Shale gas [14]. Economic modelling from Imperial College's Centre for Climate Finance and Investment has suggested ‘Carbon Dividends’. A £50/tonne of CO2 tax could be channeled into UK households in order to stimulate consumer spending whilst keeping oil prices at the same level as February 2020 [15]. However, this relies on turbulence between Saudi Arabia and Russia, thus should not be considered sustainable for the long-term.\n\nGo to:\n3. Secondary sectors\n3.1. Manufacturing industry\nA survey conducted by the British Plastics Federation (BPF) explored how COVID-19 is impacting manufacturing businesses in the United Kingdom (UK). Over 80% of respondents anticipated a decline in turnover over the next 2 quarters, with 98% admitting concern about the negative impact of the pandemic on business operations [16]. Importation issues and staffing deficiencies stood out as the key concerns for businesses due to disruption to supply chains and self-isolation policies. Indeed, for many roles within a manufacturing company, ‘working from home’ is not a viable option. As the UK is adopting similar protective measures to the rest of the world, and due to the global overlap of supply chains, we can expect these anxieties to transcend borders. The Chemical Industry is predicted to reduce its global production by 1.2%, the worst growth for the sector since the 2008 financial crash [17]. Major chemical manufacturing companies such as BASF who were in the process of upscaling production in China have had to delay their activities, contributing to a slowdown in predicted growth [17,18].\n\nGo to:\n4. Tertiary sectors\n4.1. Education\nCOVID-19 has affected all levels of the education system, from pre-school to tertiary education. Different countries have introduced various policies, ranging from complete closure in Germany and Italy [19] to targeted closure in the United Kingdom for all but the children of workers in key industries [20]. Additionally, over 100 countries have imposed a nationwide closure of educational facilities. UNESCO estimates that close to 900 million learners have been affected by the closure of educational institutions (Fig. 1 ) [21].\n\nFig. 1\nOpen in a separate window\nFig. 1\nGlobal impact of COVID-19 on school closures. Figure produced by UNESCO [21].\n\nWhilst the intention of these closures is to prevent spread of the virus within institutions and prevent carriage to vulnerable individuals, these closures have had widespread socioeconomic implications.\n\nCOVID-19 has had an impact on social mobility whereby schools are no longer able to provide free school meals for children from low-income families, social isolation and school dropout rates. It has also had a significant impact on childcare costs for families with young children. Additionally, there exists a wide disparity amongst populations with a higher income who are able to access technology that can ensure education continues digitally during social isolation. In Dubai, 13,900 people have signed a petition to decrease indepedent school fees by 30% as parents struggle to source these funds amidst recent pay cuts reaching as high as 50%, and high costs of living. Furthermore, parents are being asked to provide schools with confidential information such as bank statements and profit and loss company statements [22].\n\nThe impact of long-term school closure is yet to be seen. However a study by Chen et al. [23] of a one week closure of schools in Taiwan during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak found that 27% of families could not go to work with 18% losing income as a direct result. A study by the Brookings Institution [24], modelling closures in major US cities and nationwide, suggested that there would be a median cost of $142 per student per week. This led to an estimate that a four-week closure of New York City would result in an economic cost of $1.1bn and that a nationwide closure for 12 weeks would cost 1% of GDP. Furthermore, this study looks at the direct impact of closures on the children of healthcare workers with an estimated 6–19% of healthcare workforce hours lost. An estimate in the UK suggested that protracted closures could cost 3% of UK GDP [25]. However, Wren-Lewis [26] posits a view that this impact will be short-lived as its cause is known and defined and therefore will have a clear endpoint, unlike a normal economic recession.\n\nCOVID-19 has also influenced the tertiary sector. As well as the impact on undergraduate education [27], the most significant impact is on the postgraduate research community with research into many non-COVID related topics being placed on hold. In the United Kingdom, the national funding body for health research has halted all non-COVID research in order to allow clinically trained staff who are normally on academic secondments to return to the frontline [28]. In the United States, similar action has been taken by the National Institute for Health to shut down all non-critical research in order to free up staff and resources for ‘mission-critical’ research [29]. Outside of the healthcare research setting, several institutions have put research in fields such as the humanities and social sciences on hold with Harvard University closing all laboratories in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences [30].\n\nAdditionally, concerns have been raised regarding the number of scientific conferences that have been cancelled or postponed [31]. These conferences are the key to scientific research in many disciplines, allowing dissemination of research as well as providing networking opportunities for collaboration and job-seeking. Many conferences have moved online, however these ‘virtual conferences’ are often not as amenable to networking and informal means of scientific communication.\n\n4.2. Finance industry\nCOVID-19 has affected communities, businesses and organisations globally, inadvertently affecting the financial markets and the global economy. Uncoordinated governmental responses and lockdowns have led to a disruption in the supply chain. In China, lockdown restrictions significantly reduced the production of goods from factories, while quarantine and self-isolation policies decreased consumption, demand and utilisation of products and services [32]. As COVID-19 has progressed to affect the rest of the world, China will begin to recover faster than the rest of the countries, strengthening its trade negotiating power against the US. In fact, chinese companies will be in the advantageous position to acquire their western counterparts, which are greatly dependent and will be inevitably affected by the stock market [15].\n\nIn addition to the disruption in the supply chain, the capital market sector has also been affected. In the US, the S&P 500, a stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies on the US stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq fell dramatically until the US government secured the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, with the indexes raising by 7.3% [33], 7.73% [34] and 7.33% [35] respectively [36]. Furthermore, 10-year US Treasury bond yields have dropped to 0.67% [37,38]. In the Asian markets, the same pattern followed with China's Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and South Korea's KOSPI, initially dropping then followed by a rise in stocks after governmental support. Japan's Nikkei was up 2.01% [39]. Europe's bond yields mostly declined, reaching market stress hit levels faced in the eurozone crisis of 2011–2012 [40]. Germany's DAX, the UK's FTSE 100 and the Euro Stoxx 50 were all down on March 23rd, but rose significantly after the EU's rescue package was agreed. Gold dropped against the dollar by 0.65% [41].\n\nThe decline in global stock markets has festered a volatile environment with critical liquidity levels [42]. To combat these effects, Central banks globally have intervened to ensure liquidity is maintained and mitigate the economic shock, with several leaders embarking on a ‘Whatever it takes’ approach [7,43]. Professor of Financial Economics, David Miles, from Imperial College London has likened such government spending to the post-Napoleonic, first and second world war eras where public sector liabilities rose greatly. He further explains that bond markets could have difficulties in coping with large scale government bond issuance and that central banks may have to intervene by purchasing these bonds on an unprecedented scale [15].\n\n4.2.1. European response\nEurope has pledged a €1.7tn rescue package in an attempt to dampen the economic effects of COVID-19 on the eurozone with contributions from all member states, the UK, as well as countries in the area which do not for part of the European Union (eg. Switzerland) [44].\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a €750bn asset-purchase programme with an aim of stabilising and strengthening the Euro through the pandemic. Moreover, the European Commission has collated a €25bn investment fund for the cause and has agreed to a more relaxed policy on budget rules to encourage public spending and the support of affected businesses by their corresponding government [7].\n\nIn Germany, the state development bank (KfW) is to provide €500bn in loans to aid companies affected by the pandemic, dubbed the ‘biggest post-war aid package’ [45]. The Kurzarbeitergeld, a subsidised scheme by the German Federal parliament (the Bundenstag), will look to compensate employees who fall ill or are unable to work due to the virus [46,47]. France, Spain and Italy have also promised €345bn, €200bn and €25bn respectively, to help support businesses [44].\n\n4.2.2. UK response\nIn the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £330bn package of emergency loan guarantees to help those in financial difficulty [48,49]. A further £20bn of fiscal support has been issued in attempts to save UK businesses. The package of measures includes:\n\n• A Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\n• Deferring VAT and Income Tax payments\n• A Statutory Sick Pay relief package for SMEs (Small and Medium sized Enterprises)\n• A 12-month business rates holiday for all retail, hospitality, leisure and nursery businesses in England\n• Small business grant funding of £10,000 for all business in receipt of small business rate relief or rural rate relief\n• Grant funding of £25,000 for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses with property with a rateable value between £15,000 and £51,000\n• The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme offering loans of up to £5 million for SMEs through the British Business Bank\n• A new lending facility from the Bank of England to help support liquidity among larger firms, helping them bridge coronavirus disruption to their cash flows through loans\n• The HMRC Time To Pay Scheme\nThe Bank of England has cut interest rates to 0.1 pc, an unprecedented response, in an attempt to dampen the effects of COVID-19 [50] as well as an attempt to maintain the confidence of unnerved investors [15].\n\nOn the March 20, 2020, the Chancellor announced that the government will pay up to 80% of the salary of staff (up to £2500 per month) who are kept on by their employer [51] and has vowed to support approximately 3.8 milion self-employed individuals with a £9bn support scheme [52].\n\n4.2.3. US response\nThe US Federal Reserve (the Fed) has recently decreased interest rates by 0.5% in an attempt to soften the blow of the virus on the US Economy [53,54]. On March 23rd, the Fed also announced that it would further aid the market by purchasing $125bn in bonds. It will also offer a $300bn lending programme for Main Street businesses as well as ensure that Asset Backed Loan facility which was used in 2008–2009 would be restarted [36]. The Trump administration has managed to secure on the 27th March [55] a $2 trillion ‘virus-aid package’- the CARES Act [56], to support the economy through these times [57]. This bill is to cover:\n\n• $1200 to be given to every adult American with an income less than $75,000 or couples less than $150,000.\n• $500 for every child under the age of 17\n• Increase unemployment compensation by $600 per week, increase unemployment benefit support by 13 months and extend eligibility to the self-employed and independent contractors\n• $500bn in loans and loan guarantees to be issued by the US Treasury Department to small and large businesses. Businesses who receive such aid are obligated to keep 90% of their employees until September 30, must pay their loans back within five years and are prohibited to issue dividends for up to a year after the full amount of their loan is repaid.\n• $377bn to provide small businesses with loans and grants, $10bn for emergency grants and $17bn will also be made available to enable deferral of existing payments.\n• Student loan payments to be deferred until 30th September without penalty charges\n• Ban on foreclosures of federally backed mortgages until mid-May\n• Ban on evictions of tenants in federal housing programmes for four months\n• $25bn in food assistance\n• $100bn for healthcare\n• $45bn to be directed to the Disaster Relief Fund (which includes the supply of protective equipment)\n• $29bn in grants and $29bn in loans, loan guarantees, excise and fuel tax relief\n• $17bn towards national security\n• $14bn to farmers\n4.2.4. China and Japan response\nChina and Japan took similar action with the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) providing the equivalent of $240bn and $43bn to maintain bank liquidity, respectively [53,58].\n\nLeaders from the G20 (Group of 20) expect recovery from the economic crisis to take the form of a ‘V’ shaped curve, with a sharp and short-lived dip, followed by a rapid recovery and economic growth. Mr Angel Gurría, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), disagrees with these claims, stating that the road to economic recovery is more likely to resemble a ‘U’ shaped curve, with a prolonged period of economic inactivity for years to come [59].\n\n4.3. Healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry\n4.3.1. Healthcare\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. In particular, the risk to healthcare workers is one of the greatest vulnerabilities of healthcare systems worldwide. Considering most healthcare workers are unable to work remotely, strategies including the early deployment of viral testing for asymptomatic and/or frontline healthcare staff is imperative [60]. High healthcare costs, shortages of protective equipment including N95 face masks, and low numbers of ICU beds and ventilators have ultimately exposed weaknesses in the delivery of patient care. In the US, there is concern regarding uninsured individuals, who may work in jobs predisposing them to viral infection which may lead to significant financial consequences in the event of illness [61].\n\n4.3.2. Pharmaceutical industry\nProfound changes to the dynamics of healthcare are likely to ensue, leading to massive investment into disease prevention infrastructure, and the accelerated digital transformation of healthcare delivery. Nicola et al. have highlighted the change in healthcare policy and clinical management as new evidence emerges [62]. In the US, active pharmaceutical ingredients are imported largely from India (18%) and the EU (26%), while China accounts for 13%. China is also the biggest exporter of medical devices to the US, accounting for 39.3%. Production slow-downs and limitations in supply would inadvertently lead to revenue loss [63]. In the UK, AstraZeneca have indicated that COVID-19 is likely to affect its 2020 revenue growth.\n\nConversely, opportunities for companies engaged in vaccine and drug development have simultaneously emerged, with US-based companies including Johnson & Johnson, Vir Biotechnology, Novavax and NanoViricides having announced collaborative plans to develop a viral vaccine. A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational COVID-19 vaccine is currently underway, and will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18–55 years over approximately 6 weeks [64].\n\n4.4. Hospitality, tourism and aviation\n4.4.1. Hospitality\nThe hospitality and travel industry have perhaps been most hard-hit, with hourly workers facing potentially devastating hardships. Marriott International (approximately 174,000 employees) is poised to place tens of thousands of workers on furlough [65]. Hilton Worldwide has also notified lenders on March 5, 2020 that they would be borrowing a precautionary $1.75bn under a revolving loan to preserve money and to maintain flexibility “in light of uncertainty in the global markets” [66].\n\nHotel industry revenue per available room in the United States fell 11.6% for the week ending March 7, 2020, whilst in China occupancy rates fell 89% by the end of January 2020. Other United States hotel companies are seeking approximately $150bn in direct aid for employees due to an unprecedented fall in demand, along with an estimated $1.5bn loss since mid-February [67]. MGM Resorts International have also announced a temporary suspension in operation at its Las Vegas properties, with casino operations closing on 16th March, followed by hotel operations [68]. Since March 1, 2020, hotel occupancy in Germany decreased by over 36% [69]. Italian cities including Rome have been inadvertently affected with a current occupancy rate of 6%, whilst London remains the most stable with an occupancy rate of approximately 47% [69]. Overall, the COVID-19 crisis has led to international distortions for the hospitality industry, and significant slumps for the European hotel market.\n\n4.4.2. Tourism\nThe tourism sector is currently one of the hardest-hit by the outbreak of COVID-19, with impacts on both travel supply and demand. As a direct consequence of COVID-19, The World Travel and Tourism Council has warned that 50 million jobs in the global travel and tourism sector may be at risk [70]. In Europe, the European Tourism Manifesto alliance, encompassing over 50 European public and private organisations from the travel and tourism sector, have highlighted the need to implement urgent measures. These include temporary state aid for the tourism and travel sector from national governments as well as fast and easy access to short- and medium-term loans to overcome liquidity shortages, including funds made available by the EU through the Corona Response Investment Initiative, and fiscal relief [71]. The alliance has also called for the launch of the European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme [72].\n\nInternationally, Vietnam received approximately 1.45 million Chinese visitors in the first quarter of 2019, dropping by 644,000 in January of 2020. It is estimated that Vietnam's tourist sector will suffer a $5bn loss should the COVID-19 pandemic extend into the second quarter of 2020 [73]. Moreover, the Philippines is projecting a 0.3–0.7% slowdown in the country's full year GDP [74]. In the United States, restriction of all non-essential travel, US-Canada border closure [75], and the suspension of visa services [76] may accelerate disruption of the American economy. In the UK, many parks are now closing to further enforce social distancing as they have in Italy [77].\n\n4.4.3. Aviation\nThe travel industry is grappling with an unprecedented wave of cancellations and a significant drop in demand amid strict governmental instructions to implement social distancing and the restriction of unnecessary travel. Globally, border closures are on the rise. In the US, all foreign nationals from China, Iran and certain EU countries are barred from entering [78]. This ban includes anyone who visited these countries within the 14 days prior to their US trip. The UK Foreign Office has also advised UK nationals against all but essential international travel [79]. In Europe, the president of the EU commission has proposed all non-essential travel from outside the EU be suspended for 30 days. Travel suspensions have also been implemented across Asia and Africa [80].\n\nIn light of these events, Malaysia Airport reported a 30% decline in international passenger traffic for February [81]. More recently, Airlines for America sought a government bailout encompassing $25bn in grants, $25bn in loans, and significant tax relief to ensure survival [82]. UK airlines have also called for an immediate £7.5bn emergency bailout to prevent a widespread shutdown [83]. Ministers in the Netherlands have also reported implementing strategies to ensure the continued operation of Air France-KLM and Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, whilst the Italian Government have been said to be close to taking full control of ailing airline Alitalia.\n\n4.5. Real estate and housing sector\nThe real estate industry is facing great uncertainty due to COVID-19. At an individual level, social distancing precautions have reduced house views, a key part of the selling process, and both buyers and sellers are having to reconsider their plans. Increasingly, sellers are looking for reassurance regarding the health of potential buyers coming to view properties [84]. Some brokers are offering house tours via Skype and FaceTime to minimise the risk of infection propagation. Brokers around the United States are also asking potential buyers to preregister for viewings in order to gauge their level of interest and likelihood of purchase [85].\n\nAdditionally, thousands of workers around the world have been made redundant or have been placed on temporary, unpaid leave of absence. Inevitably this will have a significant impact on individuals’ abilities to pay rent, mortgages and various household expenditures. To tackle this, part of the £350bn lifeline the United Kingdom (UK) government has released will be used to allow mortgage lenders to offer a three-month mortgage holiday to those in financial difficulty [49]. The government has also recommended that buyers and lenders delay negotiations during the lockdown, bringing transactions to a halt [86]. Many are worried that we will face another financial crisis, similar to that of 2008 that will impact confidence in real estate. Banks within the UK have begun to take precautions; high street lenders require up to 40% deposits for a new mortgage to be approved. It is however too early to speculate on the impact of COVID-19; as of yet, the infection has not had a significant impact on the housing market [[87], [88]].\n\n4.6. Sports industry\nCOVID-19 is having a substantial impact on sporting schedules as some of the world's largest sporting events come to view in 2020. Football's much anticipated Euro 2020 tournament has been postponed for 12 months while play-offs have been postponed till June 2020 at the earliest [89]. The international Olympic committee was committed to staging the Tokyo 2020 Olympics this summer without delay. However, they have now made the decision to postpone the games to 2021, a decision that is supported by athletes and their respective nations [[89], [90], [91]]. In a similar vein, the Australian Formula one Grand Prix has been postponed with Bahrain and Vietnam opting to cancel their fixtures until further notice [89]. These are but a few examples; golf, tennis, athletics, basketball, rugby, cycling, boxing, snooker and ice-skating fixtures have all faced cancellations and delays in an attempt to curb the spread of disease. Inevitably this will have a significant financial burden, the gravity of which has yet to come to light [89].\n\n4.7. Information technology, media, research & development\nWith the WHO raising COVD-19's status to a pandemic, 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to develop an effective vaccine. Four potential vaccines are currently being tested on animals with the biotech firm Moderna entering human trials imminently [92]. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), is leading various efforts to finance and coordinate COVID-19 vaccine development [92]. They have announced a $4.4m partnership fund with Novavax and University of Oxford to develop a viable solution [92]. The Gates Foundation, Wellcome and Mastercard have also committed $125m to find new treatments for COVID-19 [93].\n\nSocial distancing precautions are paramount to the containment effort. Additionally, COVID-19 has left several hospitals in turmoil, having reached maximal capacity. As a result, various countries are turning towards technological solutions, to care for patients and at the same time, minimise the risk of person to person transmission. In various cities across China, tele-response bots powered by fifth-generation wireless networks are being utilised that allow health care staff to communicate with patients, monitor their health and deliver medical supplies [94]. Drones that deliver medication and work-from-home apps are also being adopted. Automation of services has been a major goal for China. COVID-19 has helped to accelerate uptake and has taken them one step closer to this goal [94].\n\nThe demand for respiratory ventilators has skyrocketed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. However, it is clear that the current supply across the United States and Europe does not meet demand. It is estimated that the USA has 160,000 ventilators [95]. This is 580,000 short of what would be required in a severe pandemic [95]. Governments around the world are attempting to buy ventilators. In the United Kingdom, the prime minister has asked companies such as Rolls Royce and Dyson to divert their manufacturing power to medical supplies [95]. However, industry leaders have stated that this is easier said than done as many of these companies do not produce medical equipment such as ventilators. In addition to this, production of ventilators requires strict regulation and testing to ensure their safety which can be a lengthy process [95].\n\n4.8. Food sector\nThe food sector, including food distribution and retailing, has been put under strain as a result of people panic-buying and stockpiling food [96]. This has led to increased concerns about shortages of food products such as long-life milk, pasta, rice and tinned vegetables. Panic-buying has resulted in an increase of £1bn worth of food in UK homes [97]. This high demand on food products has also affected online food delivery. Companies are struggling with excessive bookings, with deliveries arriving late or not at all [98]. Moreover, food banks have also been affected by panic-buying and food stockpiling as donations have reduced. Concerns about food running out also means that vulnerable populations who can not afford to stockpile, may not find food [99,100].\n\nIn response to these concerns, the UK government has made efforts to provide certain populations with food parcels and free meals to collect and take home. These populations include high-risk vulnerable individuals such as the elderly who have no support network, and school children of low-income families [[101], [102], [103]].\n\nThe UK government has also reduced restrictions on delivery hours for retailers in order to allow stores to restock with basic food products. Furthermore, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has reassured the public that despite low inventory of certain food products in local stores, there are no such shortages of food. Similar statements have been made by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [104,105].\n\nIn addition, despite reassurance by the government, stores have made drastic changes by restricting the amount of each product that an individual can buy, providing more than 30,000 new jobs to meet the high pressure of restocking shelves, and setting special shopping hours for the elderly, vulnerable populations and NHS stuff. Further changes being implemented include a decrease in the range of products being made by manufacturers, with the aim of focusing on products that are in greater need [106].\n\nIndependent supermarkets have also been affected by the hig",

Introduction\nWe study the local health and economic impacts of non-pharmaceutical public health\ninterventions (NPIs) like “stay-at-home” on the spread of Covid-19. Since December 2019,\nCovid-19 has spread to nearly all countries in the world. Every state and territory in the USA\nhas reported at least one case. Theoretical and empirical literature in epidemiology and\npublic health has argued, based on experience from the 1918-20 influenza pandemic, that\nNPIs can be important in decreasing local peak mortality and cumulative mortality (Hatchett\n* Corresponding author: Christopher M.

Matthias Blum, Barry Eichengreen, Gregori Galofré-Vilà, Dan Liu, Peter Sandholt Jensen, Peter Lindert,\nAlan M. Taylor and seminar participants at UC Davis provided helpful early feedback.\n2\net. al, 2007; Markel et. al, 2007; Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007 and Barro, 2020).\n1 Countries,\nstates, counties, and cities recently imposed a number of NPIs to enhance social distancing\nwith the aim of mitigating the spread of Covid-19. Have these had benefits for public health\nbut at the cost of the economy? The recent Covid-19 pandemic and associated staggered\nimplementation of local NPIs allows us to gauge whether such policies have been effective\nfor public health today and if there are economic costs to these policies.\nWe have three main results using data from US states and counties. Our county\nanalysis uses a border discontinuity design in a sample of contiguous counties spanning state\nborders. This allows us control for unobservable heterogeneity at the local level while still\nachieving variation in policy choices. First, our analysis shows NPIs are only weakly\nassociated with slower growth rates of confirmed cases of Covid-19 at the state level.2 These\nresults are likely due to reverse causality, selection or spillovers. When we compare US\ncounties with “stay-at-home” to counties across a state-border where there is no “stay-athome” order, there is no differential effect of these NPIs on the growth rate of confirmed\ncases. This could be evidence that policy changes have spillovers on behavior in other states.\nOur second main result is about spillovers. We show that NPIs from other states may\nmatter for local outcomes. Policies in other states potentially alter the information set even\nin places without NPIs resulting in seemingly coordinated behavior. Behavioral changes,\neven in the absence of policy could also be important. Third, there is little evidence that local\nstay-at-home orders are associated with declines in local economic activity that are\nsubstantively larger than in places without stay-at-home. Stay-at-home orders do limit\n“mobility” and activity around the workplace while boosting residential activity. Still,\ncommon shocks to the economy have much larger explanatory power in explaining economic\noutcomes.\nGauging the economic consequences of public health policies of global pandemics is\nchallenging. Global pandemics are rare events (Barro et. al. 2020; Jordà et. al, 2020 and\nCorreia et. al 2020), and economic theory has lagged somewhat. New insights combining\neconomic and epidemiological modeling are emerging with new theoretical predictions. The\nkey tradeoff is between public health and the economy (Gourinchas, 2020 Acemoglu et. al.\n\n1Hatchett et. al. (2007) find local NPIs reduce “peak mortality” but find mostly statistically insignificant impacts\non cumulative mortality in their sample of 17 cities in 1918-19. Barro (2020) finds the same in a broader\nsample of US cities for 1918-20. Dave et. al (2020) studies “shelter-in-place” in the US states during the Covid19 pandemic finding. They study the impact on the level of cases and deaths from Covid-19, and find, as we do\nin our state sample, that NPIs are associated with lower cases but are not statistically associated with deaths.\nThey study how the impact of NPIs depends on various observable characteristics of states. They do not study\nspillovers nor the economic impact of NPIs as we do, nor do they have a county-level analysis. Courtemanche\net. al. (2020) use the near-universe of US counties between 1 March and 27 April and find a negative impact of\n“shelter-in-place” on the growth rate of Covid-19 cases. They do not use a matched county pair sample as we\ndo nor do they study the economic implications of NPIs as we do. Kahn et. al (2020) argue for a common shock\nand study UI claims, but do not estimate an explicit model as we do.\n2 We find no relationship between NPIs and the growth rate of cumulative mortality. We largely focus on the\ngrowth of confirmed cases economic outcomes. \n3\n2020).\n3 In theory, aggressive NPIs benefit public health and help manage the health care\nresources in a pandemic, especially with limited medical capacity. In many theoretical\nmodels, NPIs may however damage the economy and create high levels of unemployment.\nBut, even without policy, people pay attention to news and events elsewhere reacting with\nspontaneous social distancing (Eichenbaum et. al. 2020; Baldwin, 2020; Krueger et. al, 2020).\nThere may also be important economic spillovers to NPIs (Beck and Wagner, 2020).\nEconomic interdependence alters the tradeoff between disease and the economy by shifting\nthe policy frontier representing the tradeoff (see Figure 1 in Acemoglu et. al., 2020).\nA pandemic can impact an economy in many ways even without public health policy:\nreductions in people’s willingness to work, dislocations in consumption patterns and lower\nconsumption, added stress on the financial system, and greater uncertainty leading to lower\ninvestment. These are respectively referred to as (labor) supply shocks, demand shocks,\nfinancial shocks and uncertainty shocks. Connected economies and epidemiological\ncommunities also move in synch. Even a healthy economy, or an economy that has not\nmandated a shutdown, may feel the impact of external events. With the exception of the\n1918-20 influenza, recent pandemics have neither had as large of a global impact, nor has\nthere been as much real time data available to empirically assess the economic and public\nhealth impact of NPIs. We study outcomes during the Covid-19 pandemic and find little\nimpact of NPIs on growth rates of cases, growth rates of deaths, and the economy. The policy\ntradeoff between health and the economy seems limited especially at the local level.\nThe reason we find no evidence consistent with a health/economy tradeoff is that\nepidemiological and economic shocks have been common to the US and indeed to the world.\nIt is difficult to save a local economy when key trade partners’ economies are suffering. 4\nBehavioral responses to the disease environment, independent of public health policy, also\nimply that outcomes are not entirely related to local policy choices - especially in the early\nstages of an outbreak.\nWe also address the issue of spillovers in NPI policy and public health: do local\npolicies have effects on other jurisdictions and territories? We find they might, at least within\nthe United States. Evidence based on mobility and activity from Google “mobility” reports,\nsuggests behavior is highly correlated in neighboring states after policies that limit\nmovement like stay-at-home are implemented. In light of this, delaying implementation of\nNPIs may have little extra economic benefit when significant trade partners have already\nimplemented such policies and when information and disease travel rapidly. This evidence\ncan account for the lack of a tradeoff between health and the economy.\n\n3 Adda (2016) studies the connection between NPIs and viral infections in a connected economy.\n4 Andersen et. al. find evidence that economic activity in Sweden and Denmark were highly correlated despite\nSweden having imposed more limited NPIs than Denmark. Correia et. al (2020) find no economic negative\nimpact of NPIs during the 1918-19 influenza in the US.\n4\n2. Methods\n2.1 Data collection\nFor public health data in US states and counties, we rely on confirmed cases and\ndeaths of Covid-19 reported by the New York Times on a daily basis. These data are based on\nreports from state and local health agencies. We have data for 50 US States + the District of\nColumbia as well as over 2000 US counties. We use data for the US between 1 March 2020\nand 25 April 2020 with exact samples depending on data availability. 25 is one of the last\ndays before localities began to loosen their NPI policies.\nData on “stay-at-home” orders at the US state-level is from the official orders or\nannouncements made by public health authorities at each state and is made available from\nthe New York Times (see the data appendix for a description of stay-at-home and other\nNPIs). We also hand collected county-level data for various NPIs and county-level stay-athome orders for over 150 counties which are matched to counties along the state borders.\nTo the best of our knowledge this is the first such systematic compilation of such countylevel data.\nEight states had no state-wide stay-at-home order (Arkansas, Iowa, North and South\nDakota, Nebraska and Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming) according to the New York Times\ndataset we use. Several counties and localities in Utah and Wyoming issued stay-at-home\norders despite no (or very late) state-wide coverage of stay-at-home. In Oklahoma about\nnine localities/counties including Tulsa and Oklahoma City issued stay-at-home orders. In\nother states such as Iowa, Nebraska and Arkansas, counties took action by closing schools,\nlimiting public gatherings and closing dine-in restaurants or by issuing their own stay-athome orders. In general, no counties opted out of state-level restrictions until April 27th after\nour data ends.\nReal-time data that helps understand the macro economy is relatively scarce and has\nonly become available in recent decades. Recent research uses real time data from private\nfinancial (fin-tech) companies to track consumer spending as well as movement based on\nprivately collected GPS signals from mobile phones. Such data is subject to measurement\nerror, reports for limited and small samples, and cannot be considered as fully indicative of\nthe macroeconomic situation (Baker et. al. 2020). Nevertheless, we rely on “mobility” data\nfrom Google as proxies for economic activity, and to gauge the impact of stay-at-home on\nbehavior. These are daily data on number of visits and length of stay in particular types of\nlocations (retail, grocery, parks, transportation hubs, workplaces, and residential areas).\nThey are measured as the percentage deviation from a baseline established in January and\nearly February 2020.\nWe also use initial claims for unemployment insurance published by the US\nDepartment of Labor (i.e., initial jobless claims) at the state level on a weekly basis. Each\nstate’s data are as of the end of the week (i.e., Saturday). We use data which are not \n5\nseasonally adjusted and which are subject to revision. Initial jobless claims represent a\nconsistent and reliable indicator of the US labor market at the local level, are of reasonable\nquality, and are often used as a leading indicator for macroeconomic forecasts. These data\nexclude the self-employed. We also supplement the economic data with information on the\nemployment shares in selected industries we believe may be hardest hit in the recent months\nsuch as oil and gas extraction, retail, food processing/restaurants, wholesale and arts,\nrecreation and leisure. We also use information on the share of jobs in a state that can be\ncarried out at home to see if this mitigated the impact of stay-at-home (Dingel and Neiman,\n2020).\n2.2 Data Analysis\nOur main dependent variables are the daily changes of the (natural) logarithm of\ncumulative confirmed cases or deaths of Covid-19. We acknowledge considerable debate\nabout measurement error due to variable testing rates across localities. We allow for local\ncounty-pair specific shocks in order to avoid this potentially confounding effect. Potential for\nmeasurement error also exists for the mortality data. There have been cases of deaths at\nhome from those not admitted to nor tested in hospitals. Using excess mortality is\ntheoretically an option but systematic data is not readily available nor directly comparable.\nWe also use the logarithm of initial jobless claims at the state-level as a dependent\nvariable. Data are not seasonally adjusted since such adjustments apply to all cross-sectional\nunits (i.e., states) and are captured in period/day intercepts. Initial jobless claims are subject\nto revision. Our data end with information on the week ending 4 April. The latest revisions\napply to weeks before and including the week ending 28 March, 2020.\nIn addition to state-level data, we use county level data in order to help define better\ncontrol groups as in Dube et. al. (2010). Our US county sample matches contiguous counties\nfrom two different states that share a state border. As discussed in Dube et. al. (2010), using\nall neighbors of a given county as a control group is not feasible. At the US county-level we\nhave total cases and deaths of Covid-19, stay-at-home orders (if different from the state),\ncounty-level NPIs, as well as the Google mobility data. We use cases of Covid-19 and the\nGoogle mobility data as dependent variables in an attempt to measure the impact of statelevel stay-at-home policies on health and the economy. We also investigate whether Covid19 cases and mobility are related directly.\nState and county-level NPIs vary in their particular prescriptions. Many counties and\nstates instituted NPIs like school closures, limited public gatherings and closed dine-in\nrestaurants and casinos, etc. Stay-at-home orders at the state or county level typically\nmandate that people refrain from meeting in groups, limit physical social interaction to\nwithin households, and that people frequent only essential businesses. In person work is\nallowed only for “essential” businesses. \n6\nThroughout our paper, we assume that the decision to adopt and the timing of NPIs\nand stay-at-home are exogenous and uncorrelated with unobservables especially\nexpectations about the future path of mortality and the expected path of economic and social\nvariables of interest. Still, we allow for leads of stay-at-home policies and show results from\nevent studies to deal with the issues of reverse causality and pre-event trends.\nWe allow for policy spillovers by measuring the level of policies in all other states. In\nour international sample, we look at policies of other countries that share a border. Each\npolicy in another state (or country) is divided by the centroid-to-centroid distance. For\nrobustness we also population weighted each other state’s distance weighted policy. States\nwith closer proximity to the observation have a bigger potential spillover since we assume\neconomic and social interactions are roughly linear in the log of physical distance with an\nelasticity of -1. The measure for state i of all other states’ NPI policies is 𝑆𝑖,−𝑖 =\n∑\n1(Stay−at−Home𝑗=1)\ndistance𝑖𝑗\n𝑗≠𝑖\n. We also introduce the sum of policies in the states which share a\nborder with state i, 𝑆𝑖,−𝑖\n′ = ∑ 1(Stay-at-Home 𝑛 n = 1) where n indexes states in the set N of\ni’s neighboring states. Similarly, we can control for the confirmed cases of other states with\ndistance weighting and in neighboring states.\nIn all models we include controls for calendar weeks or calendar day fixed effects,\nstate-level fixed effects and event-time trends (linear and quadratic, but cubic terms were\ntested). The event is defined either as the number of days elapsed between the current date\nand the date a state reached the first death or first confirmed case of Covid-19. We also\ncluster standard errors of estimated coefficients at the state level or employ two-way\nclustering as discussed below.\n3. Results: Policy, Public Health, and the Economy\nAs of mid-April 2020, there were over one million confirmed cases in the United\nStates. The US average growth rate of cases for the 56 days between 1 March (76 cases) and\n25 April (938,154 cases) was 18.3%. In New York state the number of cases grew from one\non 2 March 2020 to 282,143 on 25 April (average growth rate = 25.63%). Other populous\nstates had slightly lower growth rates: Texas (20.14%), California (14.8%), and Florida\n(19.1%). Deaths from Covid-19 began to grow quickly after the first week in March. New\nYork’s cumulative crude death rate from Covid-19 per 100,000 population grew to 113, the\nhighest in the nation by 25 April. The next five states ranked on this metric (as of 25 April)\nwere New Jersey (66), Massachusetts (39), Connecticut (52.3), and Louisiana (36.7). The\nstates with the lowest rates were rural or more isolated from the continental United States:\nUtah (1.27), Alaska (1.23), Wyoming (1.20), South Dakota (1.13) and Hawaii (0.91). We now\nexplore the determinants and economic environment surrounding these numbers.\n7\n3.1 Policies and Public Health\nTable 1 shows regression results relating the daily growth rate of Covid-19 cases and\nstay-at-home orders at the state-level using daily data. Regressions take the form\nΔln(cases𝑖𝑡) = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝛾( 𝑁𝑃𝐼𝑖𝑡) + time𝑖𝑡 + time𝑖𝑡\n2 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡\nwhere states are indexed by i, 𝑁𝑃𝐼𝑖𝑡 is an indicator variable for whether the state had\nadopted a stay-at-home order on day t, 𝛿𝑡\nis a set of calendar day fixed effects, time and its\nsquare measure event time as the number of days since the first death from Covid-19, and\n𝜀𝑖𝑡 is an error term. Data are for 1 March through 25 April.\nColumn 1 of Table 1 shows that a state’s own policy was associated with a reduction\nof the growth rate of 2.9 log points (p-value = 0.026, 95% C.I. -0.003 to -0.053). Figure 1\nshows the dynamics using an event study approach. We compare the change in the daily\ndifference of log total confirmed cases in states with stay-at-home to those without this\npolicy in each five day period before and after the policy change (nine coefficients). The\nomitted reference group is the six days up to and including the policy change. The point\nestimates are statistically significant only after a lag of about 26 days suggesting that policies\nreduced the growth rate of Covid-19 cases at the state level.5 There is no evidence of a pretrend in the growth rate of cases.\nWe continue our analysis by investigating policy spillovers between states from NPIs.\nA large majority of public schools across the nation were closed from around 16 March for\ninstance. Other NPIs and stay-at-home were rolled out more progressively.\nWe test for spillovers in a linear regression in Table 1. In these regressions, we allow\nfor stay-at-home policies in all other states to matter for state i. Policies in other states are\npopulation and distance weighted. We also allow for differential effects of policies of\nneighboring states’ policy by policies in other states with a border state indicator dummy\nvariable. We also allow for the level of confirmed cases in other states to affect growth of\ncumulative cases. We interact all other-state policies with an indicator for the calendar week\nto investigate how the timing of other state policies interacts with the cumulative policies up\nto that given week.\nOwn-state policies are always associated with lower growth rates of confirmed cases\nafter controlling for other state policies. The point estimate after controlling for spillovers in\ncolumn 4 is -0.021 (p-value =0.071, 95% C.I. -0.045 to 0.001). This is one-fourth of the\nmagnitude of the own-state policy in column 1 of Table 1 when we do not control for other\nstate policies.\nSpillovers matter -- especially after groups 2 and 3 had adopted. Policies in other\nstates dating from the week ending March 28th are negatively associated with growth of\n\n5 Courtemanche et. al. (2020) control for growth of testing capacity at the state level. We do not. They find no\nsubstantive impact on their point estimates of various NPIs in the regression model for state-level daily changes\nin total cases – a model almost identical to ours in terms of specification.\n8\ncases even in states that had yet to impose a stay-at-home policy. The association between\nlocal growth rates of confirmed cases and the second group of states’ policies is the largest.\nColumn 4 shows the point estimate is -3.324 (p-value = 0.008 95% C.I. -.0.92 to -5.72). An\nextra policy (in the week ending 28 March) at the median distance between states is\nassociated with a decline of about one-fifth of a log point or -0.002 (-0.002 = (1/1688) x -\n3.324). A new policy by a neighboring state, with the median in-sample centroid-to-centroid\ndistance is associated with a decline of almost one log point or -0.008 (-0.008 = (1/441)*-\n3.324). This is about one-third as large as the own-state point estimate. There is no\nstatistically significant differential in the marginal impact of bordering states versus more\ndistant states after accounting for distance between state centroids.\nThe association for stay-at-home policies in weeks 3 and 4 declines in absolute\nmagnitude and statistical significance in columns 2-4. By the third week, the marginal effects\nof policies in other states are not statistically significant. This is suggestive of the idea that\nthe wave of stay-at home policies at the state level implemented between March 19th\n(California) and March 28th had a bigger impact than later waves. We also cannot reject the\nhypothesis that the level of deaths in other cities (weighted by distances between cities) has\nno relationship with own-city growth rates of cases ceteris paribus.\nWe now move to analysis of a matched border county sample. Regressions take the\nform\nΔln(cases𝑐𝑡) = 𝜇𝑝 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝛾( 𝑁𝑃𝐼𝑠𝑡) + time𝑐𝑡 + time𝑐𝑡\n2 + 𝜀𝑐𝑡\nwhere counties are indexed by c, 𝑁𝑃𝐼𝑐𝑡 is the county-level stay-at-home policy, 𝜇𝑝 is\na set of county-pair fixed effects, and other variables are defined as in the state sample. Data\nare for 1 March through 25 April. Counties may appear in more than pair. We cluster\nstandard errors at the state level and in the “border segment” which includes all of the border\npairs for two states that share a border (e.g., all counties on the California/Nevada border\nwould be in a border segment). We weight all regressions with county-population.\nAlong the state borders at the county level, stay-at-home policies are not associated\nwith any differential impact on the growth of confirmed cases. Counties on the side of the\nborder that had no stay-at-home have growth trajectories of cases similar to those counties\nwith stay-at-home policies. Figure 2 shows results from an event study regression model\nwith 6,068 county-day observations and 113 county pairs. It contrasts starkly with the statelevel results in Figure 1 which showed a pronounced decline in the growth rate of cases after\nimplementation of stay-at-home.\n6\n\n6 We also ran an event study for the change in the logarithm of deaths from Covid-19. In the county matched\nborder pair sample, there is no significant difference in these changes between stay-at-home counties and\ncounties without stay-at-home. The change in log deaths is significantly lower in counties prior to adoption\nthan in other non-adopting counties- suggesting a process of selection. If we use the earlier date for softer NPIs\nsuch as school closures and limited public gatherings, there is no significant impact of NPIs on the change in log\ndeaths either. Also, in the state-level data, we see no statistically significant impact of stay-at-home on the\nchange in the logarithm of deaths relative to states without stay-at-home.\n9\nThe results in Figure 2 are consistent with policy spillovers. People in counties\nwithout rigorous stay-at-home policy may have taken a behavioral cue from nearby\ncounties/states with such policies. There is also the possibility that heterogeneity explains\nthe differences between results in Figure 1 (state-level) and Figure 2 (county-level). Perhaps\nnon-border/“interior” counties in states that adopted stay-at-home took other actions to\nlimit spread, were more likely to socially distance themselves due to individual behavior or\nregulations, or were simply more apt to comply with stay-at-home than in states that did not\nhave such a policy. Along the border, where the control group is more circumscribed, these\ndifferences dissipate. This implies local policy itself was unlikely to be the sole determinant\nof growth in cases in these places. Behavioral responses in counties without stay-at-home\npolicy may still be affected by policy, but those policies may be in neighboring counties.\nIn Table A1 we regress the change in the logarithm of cases at the county level on\nGoogle mobility measures in our matched border sample. None of the mobility measures\nhave a significant impact on the growth rate of cases. There seems to be no significant\nrelationship between the growth of cases or deaths and the state of the local economy\nassuming that the mobility data are correlated with economic activity.\nWe show below that local stay-at-home policies seem to have been associated with\nsome changes in the mobility indexes. However, the growth rate of cases is neither\nassociated with stay-at-home nor measured mobility. The dominant factors explaining the\ngrowth in cases seem to be the calendar days and the time trends. It may be possible that the\ngoogle mobility measures are poor measures of actual levels of social distancing or that other\nchannels such as within family or within residence (e.g., nursing homes) transmission are\ndominant too.\n3.2 Policies and the Economy: Local Evidence\nWe first analyze the impact of stay-at-home orders on the google mobility measures.\nThese are potential indicators of the success of the stay-at-home in achieving social\ndistancing as well as measuring the impact on the economy. Figure A1 shows the time series\nof the google mobility measures in the matched county border sample for places that\neventually adopted stay-at-home versus those counties that had never adopted. There is\nsignificant correlation between the two series implying stay-at-home orders are not entirely\ndriving individual reactions. Moreover, the time series show significant movement before\nstay-at-home orders were effective in both types of counties. The major declines for work\nand retail come around the days of 11-16 March. These are the dates around which many\nplaces announced school closures and limited public gatherings. The drops occur\nsimultaneously in stay-at-home counties and places that never adopted these policies. This\nsuggests people reacted to common information prior to policy implementation and to\npolicies in other jurisdictions.\n10\nError! Reference source not found. Table A2 shows regression results. Figure 3\nshows event study results for work and residential activity. Our regressions control for a\nquadratic time trend in event time, calendar day fixed effects and county pair fixed effects.\nStandard errors are clustered at the state and “border segment” level and we weight by\ncounty population. Un-reported results allow for a border-pair by day interaction term and\nresults are highly similar in qualitative terms.\nIn our matched border sample, workplace, retail, transit, and park activity in counties\nwith stay-at-home declined more than in those counties without stay-at-home. Residential\nactivity increased more in counties with stay-at-home. The differences are not necessarily\neconomically large being on the order of -2.48 percentage points for work (95% C.I. -3.65 to\n-1.38) and 1.44 percentage points for residential activity (95% C.I. 0.89 to 2.03). The mean\nvalues of the mobility indexes for work and residential were -34% and 14.76% respectively\nby 18 March.\nA large fraction of the drop in activity appears to be driven by a common shift\ndownwards in mobility as indicated by the set of calendar day fixed effects. These common\nshifts preceded, or were coincident with, school closures and declarations of states of\nemergency. The day indicators for work mobility become consistently negative on 10 March\n(point estimate -5.1, p-value = 0.004, 95% C.I. -8.43 to -1.76) and fall strongly and\nmonotonically so that by 19 March the common (conditional) shift as per the day indicators\nis at -45.33 percentage points (p-value = 0.000 95% C.I. -42.22 to -42.44).

We assess whether the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+).\n\nMethods\nThree analyses were conducted: (i) a comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013–17) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (ii) an assessment of the cross-sectional correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness (May 2020) and (iii) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes (March–June 2020) in loneliness (Corona panel).\n\nResults\nWe found (i) increased loneliness in 2020 compared with previous years, (ii) a moderate positive association between the number of restriction measures older adults were affected from and their loneliness and (iii) that loneliness was higher during ‘lockdown’ compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone.\n\nConclusions\nWe found evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus no strong negative consequences for older adults’ mental health are expected.

Many European countries restricted citizens’ movement and social contacts with stay-at-home orders, quarantines and ‘shut-downs’ of public life over the course of several weeks or months.3 In Austria, the so called first ‘lockdown’ began on 16 March 2020 with the closing of stores, bars and restaurants, visiting bans in hospitals and nursing care homes, closing and/or controlling of borders and regional quarantines. People were informed to stay at home and were allowed to leave the house only to go to work, buy groceries, help care-dependent others, or to take a walk, all while keeping at least 1 m distance. In total, the strict phase of these restrictions lasted for 7 weeks, between mid-March and the end of April in Austria. Since COVID-19 cases declined shortly after these measures were enacted and COVID-19 deaths remained limited, most restrictions were again relaxed throughout May and early June 2020.\n\nAlthough the enacted public health measures have limited the spread of infection in Austria in the first half of 2020 while lasting only several weeks, there could be negative psychosocial side-effects, such as increased loneliness due to social isolation. Older adults are not only more vulnerable to COVID-19, but also—already before the pandemic—had an increased risk of loneliness due to widowhood, living alone or mobility limitations.4,5 Particularly older adults who live alone might face an increased risk of loneliness, when social contacts with persons from outside the household are substantially reduced due to the pandemic.6,7 Loneliness can be defined as a negative discrepancy between the desired and the perceived social relationships,8 and represents an important risk factor for both poor physical and mental health outcomes.9,10 A meta-analysis11 of 13 studies showed, e.g. that loneliness was associated with a 26% higher risk for overall mortality, and a British study12 showed that loneliness was associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease (+27%) over 5 years of follow-up. Loneliness has also been shown to be a risk factor for the incidence of dementia,13 as well as depression.14 A number of mechanisms, ranging from physiological, neuro-endocrinological and immune functioning to sleep and health behaviour, have been suggested15 to explain this impact of loneliness on health.\n\nWhether levels of loneliness among older adults have increased substantively and sustainably during the pandemic is currently unclear. So far, only a few studies have assessed changes in loneliness among older adults with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two studies6,16 from the USA—a country with high COVID-19 case numbers and heterogeneous policy responses—found that loneliness has increased during the pandemic compared to 2019 and early 2020. However, the sample size was small (n = 93) in the first study, and the effect size was small in the second. A population-representative study from the Netherlands17—a country, which also enacted a strict lockdown—reported substantive increases in loneliness between October/November 2019 and early May 2020 among older adults (65+). Population-representative (65+) studies from Germany18 and Switzerland19—with lockdowns similar to Austria—found no clear difference between pre-pandemic estimates of loneliness and those in April–May 2020,18 or only slightly elevated levels of loneliness during lockdown compared to before and after.19 Finally, a study among older adults (aged 60–71) in Sweden20—a country, which has remained open with few mandatory restrictions and more voluntary measures—showed no change in loneliness between the years 2015–19 and (March–April) 2020. Varying results across countries are to be expected since the COVID-19 restriction measures also varied considerably across countries. Thus, evidence from more countries is needed in order to know what psychosocial side-effects can be expected if further strict restriction measures are enacted as COVID-19 cases increase quickly throughout fall and winter 2020.21\n\nIn this study, we aim to assess the association between COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness among older adults in Austria. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any well-timed individual-level survey data in Austria that would allow to compare the same older adults’ levels of loneliness before, during and after the strict phase of COVID-19 restriction measures in Spring 2020. Therefore, we use three more indirect approaches: first, we use repeated cross-sectional data to compare population-level loneliness from previous years (2013–17) from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) with loneliness measured during the pandemic (May 2020) in Austria. Second, based on cross-sectional survey data from early May 2020, we assess whether older adults who reported to have been affected by more pandemic-related restrictions, also reported to be lonelier. Third, and finally, we analyze weekly changes in loneliness among a panel of older adults over the course of 10 weeks from late March to early June 2020.\n\nMethods\nData\nThe first dataset is a national, cross-sectional survey among community-dwelling older adults aged 60+, which was conducted at the behest of the authors by a professional survey agency, the Institute for Empirical Research (Vienna) during the first 2 weeks of May 2020. A majority of the interviews were conducted online (76%); telephone interviews were used particularly among older respondents (75+) to ensure adequate coverage. Respondents for the online interviews were randomly sampled from an offline and an online panel and invited via email to participate in the study; respondents for telephone interviews were randomly sampled using random-last digit screening. The response rates ranged between 40% and 45%, and a total of 557 interviews were conducted. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Graz (EK-number 32-368 ex 19/20).\n\nThe second dataset comes from the Austrian Corona Panel Project at the University of Vienna.22,23 Here, respondents were quota sampled from a pre-existing online access panel of another survey agency (Marketagent, Baden) based on key demographics (age, gender, region, municipality, size and educational level). Online interviews were conducted weekly from late March (week 1 = 3/27/2020 until 3/30/2020)—i.e. two weeks after the lockdown in Austria began—to early June (week 10 = 5/29/2020 until 6/3/2020). The response rate for the first wave was 35.2%, which amounted to 1541 interviews with respondents aged 14–75 years. Of these, 520 respondents were aged 60–75 years at the time of interview, but a quarter did not provide valid answers to the two outcome measures at baseline, which reduced the effective number of respondents to 388 individuals with a total of 3194 weekly observations. Wave-to-wave retention rates of the baseline sample were very good: 90% (week 1–2), 93% (weeks 2–3) and between 97% and 99% in the weeks thereafter. On average, respondents provided eight repeated observations.\n\nThird, for a comparison of the extent of loneliness before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria, we also rely on data from the SHARE. Specifically, we use data from the Austrian sample aged 60+ from the fifth (2013),24 sixth (2015)25 and seventh (2017)26 wave of SHARE. Detailed information on response and retention rates for these waves of SHARE have been published elsewhere.27\n\nVariables\nIn the cross-sectional dataset, we used an established measure of loneliness, the three-item UCLA loneliness scale.28 Specifically, respondents are asked how often they felt ‘a lack of companionship’, ‘left out’ or ‘isolated’ with answer categories ranging from ‘never’ (1) to ‘often’ (4). To keep the results comparable to the UCLA-3 loneliness scale used in SHARE, answer categories 1 (never) and 2 (rarely) were combined. The resulting loneliness scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha =0.78) and ranged from 3 to 9.\n\nTo measure the impact of COVID-19 restriction measures on people’s lives, we asked respondents in the cross-sectional survey whether they were (0= no, 1= yes) negatively affected from (i) restrictions regarding freedom of movement, (ii) not being able to see children or grandchildren in person, (iii) not being able to visit care-dependent older family members, (iv) not being able to visit seriously or terminally ill family members, (v) not being able to participate in family celebrations/funerals, (vi) restrictions regarding social (e.g. sport or cultural) activities and (vii) restrictions concerning visiting restaurants and cafes. These seven aspects were summed-up (range =0–7, Cronbach’s alpha =0.73) to quantify the exposure to COVID-19 restriction measures.\n\nFurther variables in the cross-sectional survey included sex (female/male), age (in years), completed high-school education (no/yes), living alone (no/yes), depressive symptoms based on how strongly (1 = not at all, 5 = very strongly) respondents felt indifferent, depressed, worthless, hopeless, or suicidal in the last two weeks (Cronbach’s alpha =0.85) and whether respondents had one or more chronic diseases (no/yes) potentially relevant for a COVID-19 prognosis (chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and/or stroke, cancer and diseases/therapies that suppress the immune system).\n\nIn the longitudinal Corona panel data, there are two single-item measures of loneliness: first, respondents were asked how strongly they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: ‘I miss contact with other people’, with answer categories ranging from ‘applies completely’ (1) to ‘does not apply at all’ (5). The variable was dichotomized, so that respondents who answered with ‘applies completely’, ‘rather applies’ or ‘partly applies’ were coded as having missed contact (1), and those who answered that this does ‘not’ or ‘rather not’ apply were coded as 0. Second, participants were asked how often they felt lonely during the last week. Possible answer categories included ‘never’ (1), ‘on some days’ (2), ‘multiple times a week’ (3), ‘almost every day’ (4) and ‘everyday’ (5). We categorized respondents who answered ‘never’ as not having felt lonely (=0) during last week, and all others as having felt lonely (=1).\n\nOther variables in the Corona panel data included the same socio-demographics as in the cross-sectional dataset, i.e. sex (female/male), age (in years), completed high-school education (no/yes) and living alone (no/yes), and whether respondents had one or more relevant chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis B, chronic obstructive lung disease, chronic kidney disease or cancer).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFirst, we compared population-level loneliness (UCLA-3) between three pre-pandemic waves of SHARE Austria and our within-pandemic cross-sectional survey study. Second, we used linear regression models to assess the association between how strongly respondents were affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and their level of loneliness based on the cross-sectional sample. We adjusted the analyses for all variables, and we assessed whether the effect of restriction measures was moderated by living alone. Third, we used mixed logistic regression models with random intercept and random slope (week) effects to assess how loneliness changed over the course of 10 weeks in the longitudinal dataset. Since loneliness might change non-linearly over time as the lockdown phase was followed by subsequent re-opening phase, we used a flexible thin-plate regression spline29 to estimate the effect of time. To assess whether change in loneliness was moderated by living alone, we tested for interaction effects between living alone and (non-linear) time. Model comparisons were based on the Watanabe Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC). All models were estimated with ‘brms’ (v.2.13.5), a front-end for ‘RStan’ (v.2.21.2) in R: a language and environment for statistical computing (v.4.0.2).\n\nResults\nSocio-demographic characteristics were comparable in the cross-sectional and the longitudinal sample (Supplementary table S1). In the cross-sectional survey from early May 2020, respondents reported to be negatively affected on average by 3.4 aspects (SD = 1.6) of the pandemic-related restrictions. More specifically, 80.7% stated they were affected negatively by not being able to visit restaurants and bars, 72.4% by not being able to participate in social, sport or cultural activities, 62.6% by restricted freedom of movement, 57.8% by not being able to see children or grandchildren in person, 36.0% by not being able to participate in family celebrations (including funerals), 18.5% by not being able to visit care-dependent older adults and 9.4% by not being able to visit seriously or terminally ill family members.\n\nThe median loneliness value in the UCLA-scale was 4 based on our cross-sectional sample from May 2020. In comparison, the median value of the UCLA-scale in SHARE Austria from 2013, 2015 and 2017 was 3, i.e. lower by 1 point (on scale from 3 to 9). This also shows (figure 1A) in the distribution of values in the UCLA-scale over time. The repeated cross-sectional data from SHARE shows little change over several years (2013–17), but there is a substantial increase between these pre-pandemic years and 2020. This increase in loneliness is also visible at the item-level: e.g. in 2017, 93% of the respondents in SHARE answered ‘hardly ever or never’ to the question ‘how much of the time do you feel isolated from others?’, 6% answered ‘some of the time’ and only 1% answered with ‘often’. In contrast, in May 2020, 62% answered that they ‘hardly ever’ or ‘never’ felt isolated, but 29% answered ‘some of the time’ and 9% ‘often’.\n\nFigure 1\nResults from analyses based on cross-sectional (A, B) and longitudinal (C–E) data on loneliness.

Results from the linear regression model (Supplementary table S2) confirm the association between the number of pandemic-related restrictions respondents were affected by and their level of loneliness (figure 1B). Despite adjustment for a number of potential confounders, including living alone, the presence of chronic diseases and depressive symptoms, we found that respondents who reported to be affected by more pandemic-related restrictions, also felt lonelier [unadjusted effect size =0.36 (CI-95 = 0.28–0.45); adjusted effect size =0.28 (CI-95 = 0.20–0.35)] The moderation effect of living alone did not improve model fit [without interaction effect: WAIC = 1871 (SE = 55); with interaction effect: WAIC = 1873 (SE = 55); WAIC weight =76% for the model without interaction effect].\n\nThe trend in the reported proportion of the two loneliness items from the Corona panel during the lockdown phase and the subsequent re-opening phase is shown in Panel C (figure 1). We find that missing social contacts showed a substantive reduction after the lockdown ended (mean value during lockdown phase =56.6%, mean value during re-opening phase =45.8%), while ‘feeling lonely’ decreased less (mean value during lockdown phase =32.4%, mean value during re-opening phase =28.6%) over the same period. Results from the logistic mixed regression model on how loneliness changed over time during the pandemic are shown in figure 1D and E and Supplementary table S3. The change in the predicted probability of missing social contacts confirms the strong decrease shortly after the restrictions were lifted. The moderation effect of living alone did not improve model fit [WAIC = 2617 (SE = 86) vs. WAIC = 2619 (SE = 85), WAIC weight =0.71 for the model without interaction effect]. Living alone, however, was a relevant moderator for the trend in feeling lonely [WAIC = 2105 (SE = 86) vs. WAIC = 2113 (SE = 86); WAIC weight =97% for the model with moderation effect]: while there was little change among older adults who lived with others over time, the probability of feeling lonely decreased substantively (from 30% to 40% during lockdown to 10% at the end of the observation period) among older adults who lived alone.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this analysis, we assessed the association between COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness among older adults in Austria. In summary, we found (i) loneliness levels to have increased in 2020 in comparison with earlier years, (ii) an association between the number of restriction measures older adults were affected by and their loneliness and (iii) that loneliness was higher during lockdown compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. Together, these results suggest that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults.\n\nOur results are compatible with findings of studies from the USA,6,16 Switzerland19 and the Netherlands,17 which also found increased levels of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plausible impact of COVID-19 restriction measures on loneliness among older adults is further corroborated by findings from Sweden,20 where restriction measures were limited and loneliness levels did not change either. Different to previous work, we measured the number of COVID-19 restriction measures older adults were affected by also directly. We found a moderate association between the number of COVID-19 restriction measures participants were affected by and their loneliness while adjusting for a number of control variables, which, importantly, included depressive symptoms. Also different to previous studies, we used intensive (i.e. weekly) longitudinal data to follow how reported loneliness responded to the lifting of COVID-19 restriction measures. We found a close temporal correspondence: soon after the restrictions were relaxed, older adults were considerably less likely to report missing social contacts, and, for those who live alone, also to report feeling lonely. Similarly, a Swiss study19 also found that as soon as restriction measures were eased, loneliness decreased, albeit only slightly. Therefore, we expect this to be a rather short-lived effect, so that a few weeks after restrictions are relaxed or lifted, the prevalence of loneliness should return to the levels before strict restriction measures were enacted. Although we therefore do not expect strong negative mental health consequences downstream,16 the increased distress of even short-term loneliness might be enough to clinically worsen mental health among particularly vulnerable older adults. More research is needed to address and mitigate negative mental health consequences of COVID-19 restriction measures among particularly vulnerable older adults, e.g. those with pre-existing mental health issues.30,31 Also, although we consider the effect of the restriction measures on loneliness to be short-lived, this does not necessarily mean that loneliness levels will go back to the pre-pandemic long-term average level. Indeed, loneliness levels were still above the long-term average in May 2020, i.e. several weeks after the strict ‘lockdown’ phase had ended. Fear of infection, caution and voluntary, preventive limiting of social contacts may operate above and beyond public health restriction measures and may result in negative mental and physical health consequences for older adults who perceive themselves—or are perceived by others—as particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Finally, it is unclear whether the suggested lagged dose–effect relationship between COVID-19 restriction measures and levels of loneliness was not, at least partly, due to the novelty of the situation. The effects on loneliness, and subsequent mental health issues, could be both more long-lasting and severe if restriction measures during the current second wave of COVID-19 are enacted over longer time periods and/or repeatedly, in other words, if social distancing and/or isolation becomes the ‘new normal’ over a longer period until a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 become widely available.\n\nThere are several noteworthy limitations to our analysis. First, there is no population-representative, individual-level longitudinal data available in Austria that covers loneliness among the same older adults before the pandemic, during the first lockdown phase and after it. In consequence, we used three more indirect analyses: (i) a comparison of cross-sectional survey data during the lockdown with pre-pandemic repeated cross-sectional data from SHARE, (ii) an assessment of the association between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness and (iii) an analysis of weekly changes in loneliness during and after the first lockdown in Austria. Although these analyses cannot substitute for consistent, high-quality, individual-level longitudinal survey data, we consider them the best available approximations to assess the likely impact of COVID-19 restriction measures on loneliness among older adults in Austria. Second, in contrast to the cross-sectional data analysis where an established instrument for loneliness was used, loneliness was measured in the longitudinal data only with two single ordinal items, which were further dichotomized during the analysis. Thus, we did not analyze changes in the frequency of loneliness. Third, it is unclear whether both the cross-sectional and longitudinal samples are representative for the population of older adults regarding loneliness. Older adults with severe health impairments—which are more likely to feel lonely due to loss of partners, siblings and friends—are generally less likely to participate in (online) survey studies,32,33 and residents of care-homes, which were particularly affected by visiting bans,34 were not included in the sampling strategy at all. Conversely, it could also be that older adults who are lonely during the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly eager to participate in (telephone) surveys for the social interaction and/or to voice their grievances. In the Corona panel specifically, about one-quarter of the respondents did not provide valid information on loneliness, and this was more prevalent among women and those with higher educational qualification, which may bias our results. Also, in the Corona panel, there were no participants aged 76 year or older as these are difficult to reach with online interviews. However, in the cross-sectional survey, which combined online- and telephone interviews and included older adults up to age 89, we found no difference due to the interview mode (telephone vs. online interview) in loneliness.\n\nIn conclusion, our results provide evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria indeed increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects are likely short-lived, and thus, we do not expect strong negative consequences for older adults’ mental health. Nonetheless, effects of longer and/or repeated future restriction measures aiming at social distancing should be closely monitored.\n\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data are available at EURPUB online.\n\nData availability\nData from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) are freely accessible for researchers upon registration (http://www.share-project.org/data-access.html).

Data of 38,353 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior research were used. For movement behaviors, participants reported the frequency and duration of physical activity and daily time on TV viewing and computer/tablet use before and during the pandemic period. Participants also reported the frequency of loneliness, sadness (feeling sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety feelings (feeling worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period. Sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, country region, and time adhering to the quarantine were used as correlates. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression models for the data analysis. The prevalence of all movement behavior clusters increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cluster of all three unhealthy movement behaviors increased from 4.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9–5.4) to 26.2% (95% CI: 24.8–27.7). Younger adults, people with higher academic achievement, not working or working at home, and those with higher time in quarantine presented higher clustering. People that increased one and two or three unhealthy movement behaviors were, respectively, more likely to present loneliness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41 [95% CI: 1.21–1.65] and OR = 1.71 [95% CI: 1.42–2.07]), sadness (OR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.06–1.48] and OR = 1.73 [95% CI: 1.42–2.10]), and anxiety (OR = 1.34 [95% CI: 1.13–1.57] and OR = 1.78 [95% CI: 1.46–2.17]) during the COVID-19 quarantine. Clustering of unhealthy movement behaviors substantially increased and was associated with poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIssue Section: COVID-19 Pandemic\nImplications\nPractice: Individuals should practice physical activity according to the recommendations during the quarantine, as well as decrease the time in sedentary behaviors with the objective of protecting mental health during the quarantine.\n\nPolicy: Policymakers should be aware of increases in the prevalence of clusters of unhealthy movement behaviors, which can be associated with increases in chronic diseases, and develop public policies to encourage the practice of physical activity according to the recommendations, especially considering the mostly affected subgroups of the population.\n\nResearch: Researchers should continue to monitor the prevalence of unhealthy movement behaviors clusters and determinants as well as to formulate as well as test possible interventions during the COVID-19 period and after.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe practice of physical activity and low sedentary behavior are important behaviors for health promotion, reported as protective factors for several negative physical and mental health outcomes [1–3]. In addition to their isolated approach, the co-occurrence of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior is associated with a greater increase in the risk for mental and physical negative health outcomes [4–6]. However, the prevalence of physical inactivity and elevated sedentary behavior are high worldwide [7,8], especially considering Latin America countries, which present even higher prevalences of physical inactivity and elevated sedentary behavior [7–9].\n\nAlthough these unhealthy behaviors have been public health concerns for several years, the current COVID-19 pandemic has made this situation even worse [10]. The measures of social distancing and “stay-at-home” messages, effective for controlling the pandemic, have directly affected these movement behaviors [11]. Quarantine measures reduce opportunities for physical activity, especially outdoor activities, and increase daily sedentary behaviors [12], which can affect cardiovascular [13], metabolic [14], and mental health [15]. However, although recent studies have shown the potentially harmful effects of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic [16,17], less attention has been paid to the population groups that are clustering these unhealthy behaviors. In recent years, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors have been pointed out as distinct behaviors; however, stronger evidence suggests that the coexistence of both increases the risk of many negative health outcomes and mortality [18,19]. In addition, it was shown that the different types of sedentary behaviors (e.g., TV viewing and computer use) are specifically associated with mortality risk in interactions with physical activity [4], and the effects of the different sedentary behaviors have been especially identified regarding mental health outcomes [20]. Given that previous findings showed that sedentary behavior and reductions in physical activity can be negatively associated with mental health even after periods as short as 2 weeks [21,22], the negative effect of clustering physical inactivity and different types of sedentary behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic may not only be summed but also amplified. Thus, we identified unhealthy movement behavior clusters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated whether changes in the number of unhealthy behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine are associated with mental health issues.\n\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe “Brazilian behavioral research during the COVID-19 pandemic” is a nationwide health survey that used a virtual questionnaire to assess the changes that occurred in the lives of Brazilians after the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic in the country, related to social restriction initiatives to protect people, including quarantine. Data collection was conducted between April 24 and May 24, 2020.\n\nParticipants were invited through a chain sampling procedure. In the first stage, the 15 researchers involved in the study chose a total of 200 other researchers from different states in Brazil, as well as 20 people each from their social networks, making a total of 400 people chosen. The people chosen in the first stage were denominated influencers. These 400 sent the survey link to at least 12 people from their social networks, obeying a stratification by sex, age range (18–39; 40–59; and 60+), and education level (incomplete high school or less; education complete medium or more). In addition, information about the study was disseminated through press releases, social communications from participating research institutions, state health departments, and social media. The survey link was also available at the influencers’ research institutions. All procedures were approved by the National Research Ethics Commission (process: 30598320.1.0000.5241). Initially, 45,161 participants completed the questionnaire. The sample was weighted according to characteristics from the 2019 National Household Sample Survey (conducted annually), considering the population in each state, education, age, sex, and prevalence of chronic diseases, aiming to include a nationally representative sample.\n\nMovement behaviors\nThe questionnaires of physical activity and TV viewing were based on the questionnaire of the “Brazilian Telephone-based Risk Factor Surveillance System for Chronic Diseases,” which is an annual Brazilian survey begun in 2006. A previous study found good reproducibility for physical activity during leisure time (K = 0.70) and moderate reproducibility for TV viewing (K = 0.56) and also good values in comparison with the global physical activity questionnaire [23]. For physical activity before the COVID-19 pandemic, participants were asked “Before the COVID-19 pandemic, how many days a week did you practice any type of physical exercise or sport? (do not consider physical therapy).” Possible answers were: (a) less than 1 day/week; (b) 1–2 days/week; (c) 3–4 days/week; or (d) 5 or more days/week. For those reporting physical activity practice, we also asked: “How long did this activity last?” Possible answers were: (a) less than 30 min; (b) 30–45 min; (c) 46–60 min; or (d) more than 1 hr. For physical activity during the COVID−19 pandemic, participants were asked: “During the COVID-19 pandemic how many days a week did you practice any type of physical exercise or sport? (do not consider physical therapy).” Possible answers were: (a) less than 1 day/week; (b) 1–2 days/week; (c) 3–4 days/week; or (d) 5 or more days/week. For those reporting physical activity practice, we also asked: “How long did this activity last?” Possible answers were: (a) less than 30 min; (b) 30–45 min; (c) 46–60 min; or (d) more than 1 hr. We classified activities using the recommendation of 150 min/week [24], which was calculated using the median point of frequency and duration in each category.\n\nFor TV viewing, participants were asked: “Usually, before the pandemic, how many hours a day did you spend watching television?” and “During the pandemic, how many hours a day did you watch television?” Possible answers for both were (a) none; (b) less than 1 hr/day; (c) between 1 and less than 2 hr/day; (d) between 2 and less than 3 hr/day; (e) between 3 and less than 4 hr/day; (f) between 4 and less than 5 hr/day; (g) between 5 and less than 6 hr/day; and (h) 6 hr/day or more. For the assessment of computer/tablet use, we also used two questions “Usually, before the pandemic, how many hours a day did you spend using a computer or tablet?” and “During the pandemic, how many hours a day did you spend using a computer or tablet?” with an open answer. TV viewing and computer/tablet use were classified using the cutoff point of 4 hr/day at both moments (before and during the quarantine), especially considering the substantial increase in cardiovascular risk and depressive symptoms of 4 hr/day of TV viewing, which we standardized to computer use [25,26]. We created four mutually exclusive clusters of unhealthy movement behaviors: (a) inactive + high TV viewing; (b) inactive + high computer/tablet use; (c) high TV viewing + high computer/tablet use; and (d) inactive + high TV viewing + high computer/tablet use.\n\nMental health\nAs mental health indicators, we adopted three questions regarding feelings of loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. For loneliness, participants were asked: “During the pandemic period, how often did you feel isolated or alone?,” for sadness: “During the pandemic period, how often did you feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed?,” and for anxiety: “During the pandemic period, how often did you feel worried, anxious, or nervous?” Possible answers for each question were: (a) “Never,” (b) “A few times,” (c) “Often,” or (d) “Always.” We classified participants as positive for loneliness, sadness, and anxiety if they answered “often” or “always.”\n\nCorrelates\nWe used sex, age group (18–39, 40–59, and ≥ 60 years), country region (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Midwest), highest academic achievement, working status during the pandemic, change in income, and time adhering to quarantine as correlates. Academic achievement was classified as no academic achievement or elementary school, high school, and higher education or more. Working status during quarantine was classified as currently not working, working in a normal routine, and home office. Change in income was assessed by asking the participants about how their income had changed since the beginning of the COVID−19 pandemic, classified as (a) maintained or increased, (b) slightly reduced, or (c) substantially reduced or lost their income. The time adhering to quarantine was assessed through a question asking about adherence to quarantine. Those that answered adherence through staying at home and just going shopping at the supermarket and pharmacy or staying strictly at home, leaving only for health care needs also reported the duration of these measures. We classified adherence into no adherence to quarantine, less than 1 month, 1–2 months, and 2 or more months in quarantine.\n\nStatistical procedures\nWeighted frequencies, 95% confidence intervals, and difference in percentage points (p.p.) were used to describe the clustering of unhealthy movement behaviors in the general sample, as well as according to correlates. Crude and adjusted (adjusting for sex, age group, academic achievement, working status during the quarantine, change in income, and quarantine adherence) logistic regression models were created to analyze the association of changes in the number of unhealthy movement behaviors with mental health indicators. All analyzes were conducted using the software Stata 15.1.\n\nRESULTS\nDue to missing data, our final sample was composed of 38,353 adults. The prevalences of each cluster of unhealthy movement behaviors are presented in Fig. 1. All clusters presented increased prevalence, including inactive + high TV viewing (3.3 p.p.), inactive + high computer/tablet use (7.7 p.p.), high TV viewing + high computer/tablet use (1.3 p.p.), and inactive + high TV viewing + high computer/tablet use (21.6 p.p.).\n\nFig 1\nChanges in the prevalence of clustering movement behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil (N = 38,353).

High TV or computer/tablet use refers to the cutoff point of 4 hr/day.\n\n\nThe increase in the number of unhealthy movement behaviors was substantial (Fig. 2) considering that 20.5% of those reporting no unhealthy behaviors before the pandemic changed to reporting three during the pandemic and 38.6% changed to reporting two. Similarly, those reporting only one unhealthy behavior before the pandemic were more likely to increase to two (44.0%) or three (22.2%) during the pandemic, while those reporting two or three unhealthy behaviors before the pandemic presented a stability pattern. The prevalence of people that presented two or three unhealthy behaviors before the pandemic and reduced to zero during the pandemic was lower than 1% each.\n\nFig 2\nPrevalence of the number of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the number of unhealthy behaviors before the pandemic in Brazil (N = 38,353)\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPrevalence of the number of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the number of unhealthy behaviors before the pandemic in Brazil (N = 38,353)\n\n\nTable 1 shows the changes in the prevalence of clustering of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors according to correlates. In general, the clustering of the three unhealthy movement behaviors was high, with a crude difference ranging between 13.5% and 26.0% depending on the subgroup. Considering the correlates, a greater increase in the prevalence of clustering unhealthy movement behaviors occurred among younger adults, people with higher academic achievement, those with a different routine of working during the pandemic (not working or home office), and those with a longer time adhering to quarantine.\n\n\nTable 1Changes in the prevalence of unhealthy movement

Our main findings were that the clustering of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors substantially increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially considering the clustering of all three unhealthy behaviors. A quarter of Brazilian adults are inactive and spend more than 8 hr in sedentary behaviors during the day (TV viewing + computer/tablet use), which significantly increases the risk for mortality [18]. Furthermore, the increase in the number of unhealthy movement behaviors was associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBoth physical inactivity and sedentary behavior were highly prevalent before the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that the prevalence of physical inactivity was approximately 40% in Latin America [7] and the prevalence of high sedentary behavior was between 14% and 58%, depending on the indicator [9]. However, the co-occurrence of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior was not evaluated using nationally representative cohorts. In our study, we found that the co-occurrence of physical inactivity, high TV viewing, and high computer/tablet use substantially increased, more than doubling in all the population subgroups. However, some subgroups were more affected by the elevation in the clustering rates. Young adults, those with higher academic achievement, without a normal work routine, and with a longer time adhering to quarantine presented higher rates of clustering.\n\nSome aspects could underlie these associations. Younger adults present lower rates of physical inactivity, as well as TV viewing, which could contribute to a higher increase in the clustering of both behaviors [8,9]. Similarly, participants with higher educational status present lower physical inactivity, especially during leisure time, as well as TV viewing, which could be associated with a higher increase in these behaviors [9,27]. The exception is considering the higher prevalence of clustering of high computer/tablet use and physical inactivity, which is consistently high among younger adults and people with higher academic achievement. These findings highlight that, with the increases in the clustering rates during the COVID-19 quarantine, the subgroups with lower rates before the pandemic became similar (younger adults, higher academic achievement, and working in home office) or higher (longer time adhering to quarantine and not working during the pandemic). Thus, to tackle physical inactivity and elevated sedentary behaviors during the pandemic, it is necessary to change the target subgroups and strategies used before the pandemic [28].\n\nOur study also found that the increase in the number of unhealthy behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic increased the odds for poorer mental health indicators. These findings agree with a potential joint association between physical activity and sedentary behavior in the association with mental health, with an additive association [5,6]. In this sense, both sedentary behavior and physical activity are risk factors for mental health and their co-occurrence can increase the risk [5,6], especially considering the substantial increase in the odds given an increase of two or three unhealthy movement behaviors.\n\nSeveral mechanisms can explain part of the association of changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior during the COVID-19 quarantine with poorer mental health. Biologically, sedentary behavior can be associated with inflammatory markers even after short periods of time, which can be associated with poorer mood indicators [22]. As a social aspect, lower physical activity may be associated with lower social interactions, which can be detrimental for mental health, especially for loneliness feelings [29,30]. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic brought a massive amount of negative news both on the television and internet (especially social media), which is associated with worse mental health indicators, and could also partly explain the association of TV viewing and computer use with mental health [31–33].\n\nOur study analyzed more than 35,000 Brazilian adults from a nationwide sample, weighted for national representativity to investigate the pattern of clustering unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 quarantine, as well as its association with mental health indicators in one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [34]. Given the urge for representative studies to identify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine on movement behaviors and their consequences, we consider that these findings advance the knowledge and reinforce the need to promote active lifestyles that can mitigate the harmful effects of the quarantine period on people’s health. Despite this, our findings should be considered in the light of potential limitations. First, the self-reported data and retrospective design are prone to recall bias. Second, considering the web-based assessment, participants with extremely low socioeconomic conditions, who were more affected by the pandemic, were underrepresented, potentially affecting the results. Third, physical activity and sedentary behavior questionnaires have some bias as participants frequently overestimate time in leisure-time physical activity and underestimate sedentary behavior [35,36]. Fourth, we adopted a specific indicator of physical activity (exercise/sport), which did not consider other domains of the day (e.g., domestic, transport, and occupational activities), as well as the pattern of the movement behaviors in terms of breaks and bouts.\n\nIn conclusion, the clustering of unhealthy movement behaviors substantially increased during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine, especially considering some subgroups of the population (e.g., younger adults, higher academic achievement, working in home office, not working during the pandemic, and longer time adhering to quarantine). These increases are associated with poorer mental health outcomes.",

Haddad  Inácio F. Araújo  Fernando S. Perobelli\nFirst published: 29 July 2020 https://doi.org/10.1111/rsp3.12320Citations: 2\n\nAbstract\nThe aim of this paper is to assess the regional economic impact of the lockdown measures ordered by the national government to prevent the spread of COVID‐19. Using an input–output model, we estimate the economic loss of extracting groups of formal and informal workers from different economic sectors. Results show monthly economic losses that represent between 0.5% and 6.1% of national GDP, depending on the scenario considered. Accommodation and food services, real estate, administrative services, construction and trade are the most affected sectors. Regionally, Antioquia, Boyacá, San Andrés, Santander and Valle del Cauca appear as highly vulnerable to these restrictions.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nAs the rest of the world, Colombia is facing a strong economic shock due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. After a good performance in 2019, with a growth rate of 3.3% compared with the Latin American and the Caribbean average of 0.1% (Cepal, 2020), expectations for Colombia's economic growth in 2020 were near 3.5%. However, the first quarter of the year ends up with the economy facing two major shocks that will affect the worldwide economy in the short and medium‐term: the rapid spread of the COVID‐19 pandemic, and the deep fall of international oil prices. The coexistence of these two events is causing and is expected to cause unprecedented disruptions in the national economy.\n\nRegarding the COVID‐19 pandemic, confinement measures in Colombia began on 22 March when the national government ordered the isolation of all the population, excluding sectors considered essential such as health services, manufacture of primary necessity goods, financial and public services, communications and others. 1 Subsequently, the Ministry of Transport issued additional norms regarding transportation in the national territory. In particular, to avoid value chains disruptions, inter‐municipal cargo transportation was allowed under certain conditions including the compliance of specific sanitary measures. More recently, the national government has issued additional ordinances that relax some of these measures, allowing a gradual reactivation of the economy.\n\nIn order to understand how the COVID‐19 outbreak and the collapse of international oil prices will affect Colombian regions, we first revise the macroeconomic channels underlying these two external shocks. According to Mejía (2020a), the pandemic will affect the supply side through an interruption of international trade and the disruption of value chains, while a demand shock will be driven mainly by the reduction of worldwide economic activity. These, in turn, will result in lower household consumption and national income (from the fall in tourism, transportation, industrial and financial activities), as well as in higher national public spending.\n\nRegarding the fall of international oil prices, this shock will affect the demand side through a reduction of national income and a significant fall of imports due to the rapid currency depreciation (Mejía, 2020a). On the supply side, the drop of oil exports is expected to reduce mining and oil refining activities. Finally, both the COVID‐19 pandemic and the fall of oil prices will increase value added on the economic sectors of public administration and defence, and communications. The former due to higher public spending and the latter given the rise in demand for internet services.\n\nDuring the last weeks, a series of publications have tried to review and foresee the economic impact of the current events in Colombia and the region. The Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) is expecting an economic growth rate between −1.8% and −5.5% for the next three years, where Colombia, as an oil exporter, will be affected as a result of its attraction of foreign investment to finance its current account deficit (BID, 2020). On the other hand, Cepal (2020) concludes that economic losses due to confinement measures will represent as far as 67% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the region. Also, effects on employment could reach 64% of the formal employees in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nFor Colombia, preliminary forecasts of investment banks show that economic growth will range between −0.4% and 1.0% in 2020 (See Fitch, 2020; Goldman Sachs, 2020; and IIF, 2020). Similarly, Banco Mundial (2020) is expecting a 2% fall of GDP and OECD (2020) estimates an initial impact of the paralysis of economic activity of around 23% of the GDP. Consistent with these downward trends, the Central Bank of Colombia forecasts that economic growth in 2020 will be somewhere between −2% and −7% (Banco de la República, 2020). However, the monetary authority highlights that the magnitude and persistence of this economic decline in 2020 remains uncertain and will depend on a variety of factors including the duration of the pandemic, the fiscal space available to confront the crisis, the access to foreign sources of financing, among others.\n\nRegarding labour market impact of isolation measures, CEDE (2020) argues that approximately nine million people's main income comes from economic activities vulnerable to confinement measures, and estimates that the closure of those sectors is worth at least 10% of the GDP per month. For the whole year, the same study concludes that the fall of economic growth will be around 1 percentage point (pp) for every month of isolation. Finally, Mejía (2020b) estimates that in a scenario where the operation of vulnerable economic sectors is reduced to 37% and 49%, the losses will represent between COP 48 and COP 65 trillion (between 4.5% and 6.1% of the GDP) per month of quarantine.\n\nOne of the existing gaps in the literature so far is the regional analysis of the economic impact of these shocks. Regions will have differential effects depending on how severe the pandemic will be in each of them, their economic structure, the degree of informality of their labour market and the economic linkages across their different sectors. Although this spatial component is excluded from previous analysis, it is of great relevance in the ongoing debate of gradual reopening of sectors or what the government has called “intelligent isolation”. In particular, identifying the degree in which regions and sectors will be affected by isolation can better inform policy decisions and minimize the economic impact of these preventive measures. The main contribution of this paper is thus to introduce the spatial dimension to the analysis of the economic effects of COVID‐19 in Colombia.\n\nIn particular, the aim of this paper is to estimate the regional and sectoral economic impacts of the mandatory preventive isolation measures announced by the national government to control the spread of COVID‐19. Using an input–output model that has 2015 Colombian economic structure and is updated with 2019 prices, we remove a group of formal and informal workers from the different sectors of the economy, and compute the change in economic production and value added that follows this extraction.\n\nThe five main messages of this study are: (i) the preventive isolation measures result in a reduction of the number workers from 520,500 in a scenario that isolates only employees over 70 years old, to 13.3 million in a scenario where 60% of the occupied are isolated; (ii) economic losses vary between COP 4.6 trillion and COP 59 trillion per month, according to the scenario considered, which represent between 0.5% and 6.1% of national GDP, respectively; (iii) economic sectors with the highest losses are those related to services, including accommodation, food services, real estate, administrative services, professional and technical activities, construction and trade; (iv) Bogota, Antioquia and Valle are the departments with the highest participation in national loss; and (v) the most vulnerable departments to isolation measures are Antioquia, Boyacá, San Andrés, Santander and Valle.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows the methodology used to compute the sectoral, regional and national economic losses. Section 3 presents the results for the different scenarios, where confinement starts with only workers over 70 years old isolated and goes up to 60% of total workers in Colombia complying these measures. The last section concludes.\n\n2 METHODOLOGY\nFollowing Haddad, Araújo, and Galvis (2019); Haddad, Perobelli, and Araújo (2020), we consider an input–output flow table for a fifty‐four sectors economy. We separate workers into q different age groups, and identify payments by producers to wage earners to each of those groups (Table 1).\n\nTABLE 1.

In the context of the COVID‐19 pandemics, lockdown strategies are usually both age and sector‐specific. 2 Thus, we define q × n factors, Fq,n, 0 < Fq,n < 1, indicating the share of non‐restricted workers in each group in each sector. Therefore, for instance, if you do not want to restrict activities by workers from the health sector, we set the factor to unity; for activities that would face stronger restrictions, such as those in the entertainment sector, we set the factor closer to zero.\n\nWe then apply each factor Fq,n to its corresponding element in both the employment matrix and the labour payments matrix. In the former case, we are able to define the number of workers facing lockdown; in the latter case, we can calculate the contribution of those workers to total labour income in each sector. Once we know the aggregate income associated with restricted (and non‐restricted) workers, we use its share in total labour payments by sector together with the sectorial labour payment coefficients, urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0001. Based on the properties of the Leontief production function, we can then define a new set of sector‐specific penalty factors, Fn, 0 < Fn < 1, identifying the share of output in each sector associated with non‐restricted workers.\n\nThis approach also allows performing different scenarios based on targets for compliance to the measures. Suppose we want to examine a scenario that is both consistent with the set of pre‐defined factors, Fq,n, and a desirable level of compliance, α. 3 We can then find an adjustment factor or weight, ω to be applied across all Fq,n so that:\nurn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0002\n(1)\nOnce we have computed the factors, Fn, the next step is to use this set of information to partially extract some of the sectorial flows in the input–output table, considering both demand and supply reductions.\nInterindustry demand is:\n\n∀zij,i,j = 1,…,n,\n\nwe compute a corresponding restricted flow, urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0003, such that, final demand is:\nurn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0004\n(2)\nIn addition to supply‐side restrictions, associated with the factor Fi, additional demand‐side constraints can be added to complete the decision rule. For each final demand user, a demand‐side factor, Fu, u = c, i, g, e, can be specified. We define each Fu as follows. Fc is calculated based on changes in foregone earnings by workers affected by the control strategies for mitigating the effects of COVID‐19. While informal workers affected by the lockdown face a full loss of income, those in the formal sector may face only a partial loss, according to a parameter δ, 0 < δ < 1. We then assume labour income changes are fully translated into household demand changes. Other possible income‐related changes, such as government transfers to specific groups of workers as a measure to attenuate the effects of the crisis, would also affect Fc after properly mapped into household purchases.\n\nFi and Fg are set to unity. The implicit assumption is that investments decisions that are taking place are not affected in the very short‐run, while government expenditures are kept unchanged, from the demand perspective, so that we can use government reactions for simulating policy scenarios and providing alternative values for Fg. Finally, Fe is set to 0.75, based on the OECD projections for short‐term declines in GDP for many major economies. Accordingly, in the median economy, output would decline by 25% (https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/en/). This negative shock on exports captured by the model is particularly relevant in the Colombian context, not only because of the global demand contraction, but due to the low and highly volatile prices of oil, the most important commodity of Colombian exports (Banco de la República, 2020).\n\nThus, considering each component of final demand, fiu, we apply the following rule: ∀fiu, u = i,g,e we compute a corresponding restricted flow, urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0005, such that:\nurn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0006\n(3)\nIn the case of household demand, we apply both the supply and the demand constraints, such that: ∀fiu, u = c we compute a corresponding restricted flow, urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0007, such that:\nurn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0008\n(4)\nIn particular, Equation 4 implies that the fall in household demand is caused by the income loss of isolated workers and the supply constraints of the specific sector. The former, assuming that all informal workers and half of the formals experience a total loss of income that is fully translated into a lower demand.\nUsing the information from the original and the diminished sectoral flows, we have now two matrices of interindustry flows, Z and urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0009, and two vectors of final demand, f and urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0010. For a given vector of sectoral output, x, we can also derive two matrices of technical coefficients A y urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0011.\n\nThe extraction method, initially proposed by Dietzenbacher, Linden, and Steenge (1993), 4 consists of the hypothetical extraction of a sector in the input–output matrix. The purpose is to quantify how much the total output of an economy with n sectors could change (or reduce) if a particular sector were removed from this economy. This technique allows analysing the importance of a sector in an economic structure given its extraction and consequent reduction in the level of activity in the economy. It should be emphasized that the greater the level of interdependence of such a sector in relation to the others, the greater the impact, in a systemic way.\n\nWe use a variant of the extraction method. Instead of hypothetically extracting completely a particular sector, we extract all sectors partially, according to the information combined in urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0012 and urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0013.\n\nIn the complete model, with the original sectoral flows, the output of the economy is given by:\nurn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0014\n(5)\nUsing urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0015 as the matrix associated with restricted intersectoral trade flows due to the lockdown, and urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0016, the lockdown‐related final demand, gross output in the economy would be given by:\nurn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0017\n(6)\nTherefore, after the partial extraction:\nurn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0018\n(7)\nwhere T is the aggregate measure of annual loss in the economy—decrease in total output if the output associated with the lockdown measures “disappears.” In other words, it is a measure of the relative importance of activities performed by workers affected by the lockdown, or the total linkages with which such activities are associated.\nWe can translate sectoral gross output outcomes in other variables' outcomes, as usual. We simply pre‐multiply the vector of gross output, x or urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0019, by a diagonal matrix, urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0020, whose main diagonal contains the variable's coefficients, that is, the ratios of the variable's values by sector divided the respective sectoral gross output. Finally, assuming that production is a continuous on weekdays, daily foregone losses can be approached by dividing T (or urn:x-wiley:17577802:media:rsp312320:rsp312320-math-0021), by the number of weekdays in the benchmark year.\n\n3 RESULTS\nThis section presents the main findings of the analysis. First, we define the factors F used for the partial extraction of economic flows from the input–output matrix. Second, we describe the different confinement scenarios assumed for the labour market, emphasizing the groups of workers affected in each particular case. Third, we present the economic impact of isolation measures for the national aggregate, departments and economic sectors. Finally, we show estimations of a proposed vulnerability index that evaluates the exposition of sectors and territorial entities to isolation measures.\n\n3.1 Adjustment factors F\nFirst of all, in order to apply the methodology described in the previous section, we need to define the adjustment factors that reflect the level of restriction faced by each economic sector. These factors were defined ad hoc by the authors, based on available information from government regulations, recently published data of labour market performance, and studies that identify the most vulnerable sectors to confinement (CEDE, 2020; Mejía, 2020b). Although we do not know precisely how many workers have been affected by isolation measures and the extent of income loss they have experienced, we can approach this information using recent employment data published by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE). In particular, according to DANE (2020), the total national variation of occupied labour force between May 2019 and May 2020 was −22.1%. A significant portion of this variation was explained by the reduction of labour in non‐essential services sectors such as trade and vehicle repair, accommodation and food service activities, construction, and professional, real estate and recreational activities. In addition, 44.1% of total occupied workers reported in May 2020 that they have experienced a reduction in economic activity and income (DANE, 2020).\n\nConsidering the latter trends, Table 2 shows the 54 sectors used in the estimation and their corresponding F factors. According to these values, those activities related to the manufacturing and provision of non‐essential services are expected to face the harshest restrictions. Sectors related to arts, recreation and entertainment activities get a factor F of 0.1, while those less affected by isolation such as health services and communications have an F equal to 1.0. The remaining sectors lay in between these two F factors according to their degree of exposition to confinement measures.\n\nTABLE 2.

We start in scenario 0 where only workers over 70 years old are kept in isolation, and move gradually to scenario 6 where 60% of total workers (including those over 70 years old) are confined. Table 3 shows the details arising in each one of these scenarios.\n\nTABLE 3. Scenarios of isolation (percentage of the total occupied labour)\nScenarios\tOccupied labour in solation\tInformal workers in isolation (%)\tFormal workers in isolation (%)\n0\tWorkers over 70 years old\t2.3\t0.0\n1\t10% of total workers\t8.3\t1.7\n2\t20% of total workers\t14.8\t5.2\n3\t30% of total workers\t21.6\t8.4\n4\t40% of total workers\t28.2\t11.8\n5\t50% of total workers\t35.1\t14.9\n6\t60% of total workers\t42.0\t18.0\nSource: Authors' calculations using data from Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH) DANE.\nAccording to these results, the isolation of only workers over 70 years old (scenario 0) amounts to 2.3% of total employees confined, from which the majority are informal. Subsequently, from scenarios 1 to 6, there is a progressive increase in the percentage of workers in isolation, from 10% to 60%. Regarding the characteristics of the group in confinement, the evolution of formal and informal workers facing restrictions depends on the sectors facing these measures. For instance, in scenario 3, 20.3% of workers in isolation belong to accommodation and food services, followed by wholesale and retail sectors, with 18.3% (Appendix Table A1). These two sectors have high informality rates of 83.8% and 73.7%, respectively, 5 and thus, informal workers appear predominant in this scenario (21.6% of total employees compared to 8.4% for formal workers; Table 3).\n\nAlthough from Table 3 it is clear that across all scenarios, informal workers represent the highest proportion of workers in isolation, it is important to highlight regional variations on this component. Figure 1 shows the distribution of formal and informal workers in the isolated group across all regions for scenario 6. While the Caribbean, Pacific, Amazonic and Llanos regions appear with a higher percentage of informal workers in isolation (approximately 80%), the Central, Eje Cafetero and Antioquia regions show a lower participation of this group (near to 60%). In particular, these results coincide with the higher labour informality of peripheral regions in Colombia and also highlights the higher vulnerability of the group of isolated workers in these regions.\n\nimage\nFIGURE 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nDistribution of formal and informal workers in the isolated group by regions\nSource: Authors' calculations using data from Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH) DANE\n\nRegarding spatial distribution, the most populated departments (Antioquia, Bogotá y Valle del Cauca) encompass the highest number of workers in isolation. However, this arrangement is slightly different if we compare isolated workers with total employees in each department. Figure 2 shows these calculations for scenarios 0, 3 and 6. For the initial scenario, where only occupied over 70 years old are isolated, panel A shows that Cauca, Córdoba, Nariño and Tolima appear with the highest participation of workers in isolation, comprising between 3.2% and 3.9% of total employees in each department. Moreover, confined workers in this case pertain mainly to agriculture, wholesale and retail activities (Appendix Table A1).\n\nimage\nFIGURE 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nSpatial distribution of workers in isolation (percentage of the total workers in each department)\nSource: Authors' calculations using data from Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH) DANE\n\nMoving to scenario 3, we observe a steep increase in the percentage of workers in isolation, ranging now between 22.1% and 41.9%. As mentioned before, the sector with the highest restrictions in this scenario is accommodation and food services, where San Andrés stands out due to its significant number of workers related to these activities.\n\nFinally, moving the isolation restriction up to 60%, confined workers in each department represent between 46.8% and 64.6% of total employees. In this scenario, workers are concentrated in the trade sector and the departments of Atlántico, Bogota, Córdoba, La Guajira and San Andrés occupy the first places; an arrangement that is consistent with their high participation of employees in these activities (from 16.5% in La Guajira to 21.1% in Atlántico).\n\n3.3 Economic impact\nFollowing the aforementioned scenarios, we compute the economic impact generated by the confinement measures. The size of the estimated effect depends on four main elements. First, the adjustment factor F, which represents the restrictions faced by each sector. Second, the participation of labour income of workers in isolation on total labour payments. Following the assumption that wages equal the marginal productivity of labour, the latter reflects the extent to which economic activity is affected in each scenario. Third, the intersectoral linkages of the economy, 6 which allows sectors with no isolation restrictions to be affected through the lower demand or supply of other activities they depend on. Finally, given the assumption that informal workers lose all their income and formal workers lose half of it, higher participation of the former in the restricted group could imply a higher reduction in household consumption and, as a consequence, in regional economic activity as a whole.\n\nFigures 3 and 4 show the monthly economic loss for the national aggregate, in COP trillion and as a percentage of GDP, respectively. As expected, monthly economic losses increase as the percentage of occupied labour in isolation rises, from COP 4.6 Trillion per month in the less restrictive scenario, to COP 59.0 Trillion under the most severe restrictions (60% of workers in isolation; Figure 1). These losses represent between 0.5% and 6.1% of national GDP per month, respectively (Figure 2).\n\nimage\nFIGURE 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nMonthly economic loss of national GDP(COP Trillion)\nSource: Authors' calculations using data from Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH) and Departmental National Accounts DANE.\n\nNote: Includes the loss in the added value by sector, without taxes minus subsidies\n\nimage\nFIGURE 4\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nMonthly economic loss of national GDP(percentage of the GDP)\nSource: Authors' calculations using data from Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH) and Departmental National Accounts DANE\n\nIt is important to highlight that the marginal increase in the loss of moving from a less to a more restrictive scenario is not the same through all the scenarios considered. For example, while going from scenario 2 to 3 represents an increase in loss of 1.6 percentage points (pp) of the GDP, moving from scenario 5 to 6 represents an increase of 0.6 pp. These differences depend on the characteristics of workers in isolation and in particular, on the labour payments they represent. While the total foregone income of workers in confinement increases at a rate of 144.0% between scenarios 2 and 3, the same increase is only of 19.7% from scenario 5 to 6 (Appendix Figure A1). This, in turn, is associated with changes in the group of sectors affected by the isolation measures. While shifting from scenario 2 to 3 implies an increase in the participation of sectors such as construction and trade in the group of workers in confinement, from scenario 5 to 6, the sectoral composition of the group in isolation remains almost the same (Appendix Table A1).\n\nThese aggregate results can be further understood if distributed across all sectors of the economy. Table 4 presents economic activities with the highest participation in the total loss for each scenario. Beginning with scenario 0, the activity with the highest share in the impact is the extraction of crude oil and natural gas. Since under this scenario workers in isolation represent only 2.3% of total employees (Table 3), the economic impact, although low (0.5% of the GDP), is mainly caused by the 25% decrease in total exports assumed in the model.\n\nTABLE 4.

All countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19 by March 17. In response to the pandemic, different European countries took different approaches. This paper compares the impact of different containment measures taken by European countries in response to COVID-19 on their electricity consumption profiles. The comparisons are made for Spain, Italy, Belgium and the UK as countries with severe restrictions, and for the Netherlands and Sweden as countries with less restrictive measures. The results show that the consumption profiles reflect the difference in peoples’ activities in different countries using various measures.\n\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\nKeywords\nCOVID_19CoronavirusEuropean power systemsConsumer behaviour\n1. Introduction\nCovid-19 was confirmed as a widespread pandemic over Europe as of March 2020, affecting many industrial sectors. The first coronavirus cases were reported in Italy on January 30, 2020. It was also confirmed to have spread to Spain on January 31.\n\nAs of June 6, Italy, Spain and the UK had the highest number of cases over Europe [1]. In response, Spain’s government placed restrictions under the state of alarm declared on March 14. A series of more strict measures announced on March 29 asked all non-essential workers to stay home. Italy placed an extended national quarantine on March 9, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, such as essential work or health problems. The lockdown imposed the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. For the UK, the government announced a state of lockdown on March 23 to close all but essential businesses. People were only allowed to go outside for shopping, basic necessities, health reasons, and one form of exercise a day, or work if it was deemed ‘essential’, such as firefighters, police, electricity provision, etc.\n\nBelgium faced the highest per-capita COVID-19 death rate in Europe [1]. The Belgian government took certain measures on March 12 and ordered the closure of schools, cafes, etc. and the cancellation of all public gatherings. Stricter measures issued on March 17 ordered the closure of non-essential shops, prohibited non-essential travel, and banned all gatherings. In contrast, the Netherlands adopted less-restrictive measures to get the virus under control as much as possible. All large-scale public events and gatherings were banned, schools and day care centres were closed, and people were required to self-distance and to work from home wherever possible. Unlike many other countries however, Sweden did not impose a lockdown. The measures were limited to recommendations for people with symptoms of respiratory infection and people over 70 to isolate themselves.\n\nThis paper shows how different containment measures taken by European countries in response to COVID-19 reshaped the electricity consumption profile in these countries. The results show that the change in peoples’ activities in countries with different approaches is reflected in consumption profiles.\n\n2. Electricity consumption change amid the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe procedures implemented by the European governments to deal with the COVID-19 emergency have drastically changed peoples’ habits and activities at the national level. This change in behaviour is reflected in the electricity systems, in particular in terms of changes in electricity consumption profiles. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 by comparing the electricity consumption profiles of Spain, Italy, Belgium, and the UK, all countries with population containment measures, with the Netherlands as a country with less restrictive measures, and Sweden which did not impose a lockdown.\n\n\nDownload : Download high-res image (1002KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 1. Weekly load profile comparison for the second week of April 2020 and a reference week in 2019 for (a) Peninsular Spain [3], (b) Italy [4], (c) the UK [5], (d) Belgium [6], (e) Netherlands [7], and (f) Sweden [7]\n\nThe comparisons are between a week after the pandemic had been announced, and a reference week from 2019. The electricity demand is not only influenced by the day of the week and the time of the day, but it is also affected by weather changes. Therefore, the reference week in 2019 was chosen at a similar point in the year with a comparable daily average temperature. However, there are other factors which affect the demand, hence the comparisons cannot be perfect.\n\nIn Fig. 1, the grey line shows the trend in total national electricity demand for the second week of April (i.e. 6–13 April 2020) and the blue line shows the demand for a reference week in 2019. A comparison of consumption profiles clearly shows that for all countries except Sweden, the national demand was reduced after the pandemic was declared. The state of alarm decreed by the governments and the gradual restriction on activities to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a considerable reduction in electricity demand. For Spain, Italy, Belgium and the UK, the reductions are more noticeable. This is a direct consequence of population containment measures, and the closure of public and industrial centres as a means to curb the pandemic.\n\nDuring the lockdown, there has been an increase in domestic demand as people have been spending more time at home. However, as businesses have been shrinking their activities, the reduction in commercial and industrial demand has been far greater than the increase in domestic demand. In the case of Belgium, Elia, the Belgian transmission system operator, reported that the drop was more noticeable for consumers connected to the distribution grid compared to Elia’s 149 industrial customers connected directly to the high-voltage grid [2].\n\nFor Netherlands, remote working, the ban on public events and gatherings, and reduced activities have lowered the daily consumption. The case for Sweden is particularly interesting. For the period from Monday to Thursday, the morning peak demand was reduced. However, the usual evening peak remained, indicating that normal evening activities were still going on. For Thursday evening and the subsequent long weekend, the consumption was even greater than for the reference week of 2019.\n\nTo better compare the change in demand for the countries considered, a Demand Variation Index (DVI) is defined as follows, which presents the average reduction of demand compared to a reference period:\n(1)\nwhere  is the demand for time ,  is the demand for the same time of a previous reference period, n is the number of recorded demands, and  is the average demand during the previous reference period.\n\nFig. 2 shows the DVI for the countries considered and for the periods represented in Fig. 1. As shown, Spain experienced the highest reduction in demand followed by Italy, Belgium and the UK. For the Netherlands, the reduction was lower as a consequence of the less-restrictive measures imposed on the population. For Sweden however, the DVI was negative, which implies that the consumption actually increased.\n\n\nDownload : Download high-res image (68KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 2. Demand Variation Index (DVI) for Spain, Italy, the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, and Sweden for the periods reported in Fig. 1.\n\nIn Fig. 1, the case of Spain is particularly interesting, because it not only experienced an even greater reduction in electricity demand, but it also followed a different trend. For Belgium, Italy, and the UK, with schools, universities and most offices closed or under severe restrictions during the pandemic, the demand profile for weekdays during the pandemic were similar to weekends of the reference week in 2019. This is also true for the Netherlands. However, for Spain, weekday demand was even less than the reference weekend demand, probably as a result of the closure of large commercial and industrial centres that were active during the weekends.\n\nTo make a closer comparison, Fig. 3 shows the daily demand for a weekday during the pandemic with a reference weekday and a reference weekend from 2019. The grey line shows the trend in total electricity demand for a weekday in April 2020, the blue line shows the demand for a similar weekday in 2019, and the green line is for a weekend in 2019, all with a comparable daily average temperature. The DVI index in Fig. 4 presents the overall variation between the weekday after the pandemic and the reference weekend in 2019.\n\n\nDownload : Download high-res image (684KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 3.

Demand Variation Index (DVI) between a weekday after the pandemic and a weekend of 2019 for Spain, Italy, the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, and Sweden.\n\nOverall, for the UK, Belgium and Italy, it can be seen that after the pandemic, the weekday demand was not dissimilar, though slightly lower, when compared to consumption during the weekend in 2019. Particularly, post-pandemic weekday mornings were similar to weekends in 2019, lacking the typical morning peak as many people were now working from home and the schools were shut. This means that the typical morning electricity peak for transportation, kettles and lights was either dramatically reduced or spread over a longer period of time. The UK experiences a lower electricity consumption level during the post-pandemic day, even when compared to 2019 weekend electricity use. Belgium and Italy had lower demand during the evenings and earlier part of the night-time as clubs, cafes and restaurants were closed.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the similarity of the pandemic weekday demand and pre-pandemic weekend demand holds. However, the DVI is negative, which means that the week-day consumption was not less than that for pre-pandemic weekends. Moreover, the Netherlands still retained its morning peak for energy consumption. For Spain, the trend of weekdays during the pandemic has been similar to 2019 pre-pandemic weekends, except that the morning peak demand was delayed by a few hours. However, while the trend was similar, there was a considerable and almost constant drop in 2020 weekday demand compared to 2019 pre-pandemic weekends, probably due to the shedding of commercial and industrial loads that existed during pre-pandemic weekends.\n\nFor Sweden, as shown in Fig. 3, the consumption profiles of weekdays during the pandemic, were very similar to the profile of the reference pre-pandemic weekdays in 2019. Therefore, the DVI between the weekday after the pandemic had been declared and the reference weekend in 2019 was large and negative, which implies that the pandemic weekday demand was dissimilar and appreciably greater than pre-pandemic weekends, which clearly reflects the different approach Sweden took.\n\nThis paper discussed the impacts of the pandemic amids the weeks the containment measures were in place. As the European countries start to ease their lockdowns and restrictions, it can be predicted that the electricity consumption profiles will gradually return to their normal trajectory. However, the countries hit more severely, may experience a reduced demand for a long-term period. Moreover, probability of hitting a second wave of outbreak would prolong the low consumption behaviour of the electricity demand.\n\n3. Conclusion\nWidespread occurrence of an infectious disease may affect electricity consumption, production, maintenance, operational activities, development plans, and etc. In particular, this paper compared the effect of different containment measures taken by various European countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on their electricity consumption profiles. The results show that different lockdown measures in European countries and their effects on population activities have considerably changed the consumption profiles. For countries like Spain, Italy, Belgium and the UK with severe restrictions, the weekday consumption was considerably reduced and energy consumption profiles are similar to pre-pandemic weekend profiles for the same period in 2019. However, for countries with less restrictive measures, the decrease in power consumption was lower. In fact, for Sweden which did not impose a lockdown, the consumption even increased at certain points in time when compared to the same time period in 2019.\n\nThese interesting outcomes imply that while lockdown measures change the consumption profiles on one hand, on the other hand, these profile changes can also be a reflection of the effects of different approaches to dealing with the pandemic on people’s activities.",

          "context": "Social‐economic impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on aesthetic centers in Greece\nFoteini Biskanaki MSc, cPhD  Εfstathios Rallis PhD  Εleni Andreou MSc, cPhD  Εleni Sfyri MSc, cPhD  Νiki Tertipi MSc, cPhD  Vasiliki Kefala PhD\nFirst published: 31 May 2020 https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13517Citations: 1\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nEpidemics are a major cause of health problems in developing countries, preventing the accumulation of human capital and economic growth. On the appearance of the pandemic of the new coronavirus COVID‐19 worldwide, this survey was carried out in the 4th week of the occurrence of the cases in Greece.\n\nObjectives\nThe investigation was aimed at the social and economic impact caused by this COVID‐19 pandemic and the state's decision to suspend the operation of businesses and stores in Greece.\n\nMaterials and methods\nOne hundred and fifty‐eight esthetic centers from various areas of Greece were participated in this study, and the questionnaires were sent electronically to the business owners. Statistical analyzes were conducted using Google Forms and the questionnaires analyzed through PSPP software.\n\nResults\nBased on their answers and the statistical analyzes, it was calculated the reduction of the monthly income for the first month of suspension of the operation of their companies. Additionally, social‐related matters were examined as, how they experience this period, psychologically, financially, what problems they believe that they will face, and what changes in their work that could result from the pandemic.\n\nDiscussion\nThere is no similar study and experience for esthetic centers from a viral pandemic in literature. The suspension of operations provoked serious financial problems and significant psychological burden about what “tomorrow will bring” with returning to “normalcy.”\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe new coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) appeared in late 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.1 Since then, thousands of cases have been reported in China, in many other countries and in the European Union, including Greece. Data on the epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019‐nCoV virus infection are growing rapidly while the number of cases and deaths is increasing every day worldwide.\n\nThe first case in Greece appeared on February 26, 2020. On March 11, 2020, due to virus infection outbreak, Greek government decided firstly the closure of all educational structures and then on 13th March, the suspension of the operation of cafes, museums, shopping malls, sports facilities, restaurants, esthetics centers, etc According to Greek National Health Organization, all the cases that have been confirmed as COVID‐19 until 20th April 2020 were 2245 (56% are men) and 116 dead. The median age of death was 74 years and 90.5% had an underlying disease and/or age, above 70 years.2\n\nThe present study aimed at the social and economic impact caused by this pandemic in esthetic centers. A virus pandemic has a significant impact on social enterprises and poses a challenge to human health and global development.3, 4 The economic impact of epidemics can be divided into direct (mainly related to resources invested in the treatment of epidemics, vaccines, and drugs) and indirect effects (it can affect the job offer, the health of infected people, change the behavior of various individuals, and businesses).5 Our results are intended to assess the indirect social and economic impact of the pandemic on the Greek esthetics centers.\n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS PARTICIPANTS\nOne hundred and fifty‐eight owners of esthetic centers from various areas of Greece participated in this study. The personnel of these commercial institutions embraced secretaries, beauticians, cosmetologists, and in some cases, dermatologists. The esthetic centers’ services included permanent and medical make‐up, skin rejuvenation, eyelash extensions, body contouring and fat reduction, laser hair removal, thermolysis, electrolysis, plasma lift and fibroblast, open and closed comedones extraction, and chemical peels. These institutions closed in execution of the government's decision to avoid the contact between staff and clients and the COVID‐19 potential spread.\n\nThey were all informed about the details of the study including potential benefits and provided informed consent.\n\n2.1 Statistical and data analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using Google Forms. This platform was selected for direct and anonymous communication of research (cost reduction of research), ease of completion and processing of results (error avoidance, statistical measurements), and paper consumption avoidance (environmental protection). The questionnaires were 13 and developed through PSPP software.\n\n3 RESULTS\nThe participants were businessmen and almost all of them owned one esthetic center (95.6%, ie, 148 participants) while the rest owned 2‐5 centers. Fifty‐eight people (38%) answered that they do not have staff and 93 (58.2%) employ 1‐5 people in their staff. Only 5 esthetic centers have more than 6 staff members. Thus, by a random choice, the answers concern small and medium enterprises of esthetic centers. Only 28.5% mentioned they were concerned about the effects of COVID‐19 in December 2019. Τwo months later, their businesses seemed to be affected financially when the pandemic began to spread. Forty‐three participants (27.2%) answered that the business turnover decreased >50%. Only 5.7% of the participants were not affected financially, while the remaining 67.1% (92 entrepreneurs) had a turnover reduction of 1%‐50%. These results concerned their businesses before the mandatory work suspension (Figure 1).\n\nimage\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nPercentage reduction of esthetic centers’ work cycles in Greece due to COVID‐19\nThe reduction of the monthly turnover is calculated for the first month of suspension of the operation of the company in <2000€ for 36.1% (58 companies), in <5000€ for 19.6% (31 companies), in <10 000 for 5.1% (8 companies), and 1.9% <20 000€ (3 companies). The remaining 36.7% of participants did not answer probably because they did not want to disclose their finances.\n\nThere was one question concerning their colleague/partner attitude after COVID‐19 appearance. The positive action was that the most of them tried to reassure customers‐patients at a rate of 63.3%. However, a percentage of 22.2% had an unaffected behavior.\n\nThe 58.2% (95 of people asked) reported that COVID‐19 closure measures had a considerably big effect on their psychological condition while 17.7% (27 participants) were overly affected. There was also a considerably percentage of 22.2% (35 participants) that was the least affected (Figure 2).\n\nimage\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nPercentages of influence psychological factor of skin care professionals\nMost of the participants (62%) find the government measures over the COVID‐19 satisfying and the 19%, exceptional. Only a few criticized them as incomplete. However, they all worried about the future consequences of these restrictive measures in country's economy (Figure 3).\n\nimage\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nPercentage that they were satisfied by the decisions taken by the government when the COVID‐19 appeared in Greece\nMany participants (145 from 158) considered, a significant reduction in turnover due to economic difficulties in society was possible. One hundred and thirty‐eight participants were concerned about a significant drop in turnover due to public insecurity and 128 were adjusted to meet accumulated financial obligations. Seventy‐eight participants agreed changes in theirs every day work was probable.\n\nSixty‐two businessmen responded positively that significant advertising costs could be spent on a customer‐patient approach. Only 43 answered affirmatively about the financial deficit due to the re‐coordination of the partners and the probable reduction of the customer base (Figure 4).\n\nimage\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nEvaluations of possible problems that will arise after returning to \"normality\"\nDespite the economic and psychological effects on their individual and business environment, 86.5% of esthetic centers (134 entrepreneurs) understood the necessity for suspension of esthetics’ services in contrast with the 13.5% who found the measures exorbitant.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nInfection with the new coronavirus can be asymptomatic or present with flu‐like symptoms such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, fatigue, and myalgia. Respiratory droplets are the main route of transmission, while other possible modes of transmission may be contact with contaminated objects and surfaces.6 The incubation period is 1‐14 days and may present with severe clinical manifestations, such as pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, multiorgan failure, and death. Yet there are no drugs approved or vaccines available for the treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 infection, respectively. 7\n\nThe challenge of effective epidemiological control is to strike a balance between reducing virus transmission and cost.8 The adequacy and authenticity of disclosure information are critical to minimizing financial losses, as either public panic due to overestimation or lack of public awareness due to underestimation can have additional negative economic implications.9, 10\n\nA total of 72.3% (112 businessmen) of the first week of COVID‐19 in Greece were affected by this situation. Four weeks after the suspension of operations, there was a decrease in monthly income, and significant psychological burden about what “tomorrow will bring” with returning to “normalcy.”\n\nOn the positive side, almost all participants stated that they immediately took additional protection measures for their patients‐clients and that they considered it necessary to stop the activity of businesses and premises, indicating conscientiousness and responsibility.\n\nLiterature is lacking data concerning consequences of sudden and prolonged closure of businesses including esthetic centers from a viral pandemic.",

However, exogenously set variables, tourism and policy related, the inherent features of urban economies, such as the specialization of industry, and their inter-linkages with their peri-rural municipalities, act as stabilizers that ease the crisis effects and may support recovery.

Rajasekharan Nayar (2020): COVID 19 and its mental\nhealth consequences, Journal of Mental Health\nTo link to this article: https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2020.1757052\nPublished online: 27 Apr 2020.\n\nEDITORIAL\nCOVID 19 and its mental health consequences\nThe global community is concerned about Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its long-term consequences. It is\ngoing to impact various spheres of life such as the economy,\nindustries, global market, agriculture, human health, health\ncare, etc. At present, the focus of States and the World\nbodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) is on\ncontrolling and mitigating the impact of this pandemic by\nidentifying, testing, treating infected people, developing\ndrugs, vaccines and treatment protocols. However, despite\nsuch efforts to defeat this pandemic, we are not very sure\nwhat direction the pandemic will take in the coming days.\nThe WHO has also expressed its concern over the pandemic’s mental health and psycho-social consequences\n(World Health Organization, 2020d). It speculates that new\nmeasures such as self-isolation and quarantine have affected\nusual activities, routines, and livelihoods of people that may\nlead to an increase in loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, harmful alcohol, and drug use, and self-harm or suicidal\nbehavior (World Health Organization, 2020c). The lockdowns around the world have led to an increase in cases of\ndomestic violence where women and children who live with\ndomestic violence have no escape from their abusers during\nquarantine (Abramson, 2020; Chandra, 2020; GrahamHarrison et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020a).\nThe recent survey by the Indian Psychiatric Society shows a\ntwenty percent increase in mental illnesses since the coronavirus outbreak in India (Loiwal, 2020). Psychologists and\nmental health professionals speculate that the pandemic is\ngoing to impact on the mental health of the population globally with the increase in cases of depression, suicide, and\nself-harm, apart from other symptoms reported globally due\nto COVID 2019 (Li et al., 2020; Moukaddam & Shah, 2020;\nYao et al., 2020). Closing of outlets selling alcohol has also\nled to withdrawal symptoms and suicides by alcohol addicts,\nreported in states like Kerala in India (Jayakumar, 2020).\nThey speculate about the chances of developing neurotic\ndisorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) in large population\ngroups. Overemphasis on consistent handwashing (for\ntwenty seconds) may affect a significant population group\nglobally considering people are not aware of when and how\nmany times to wash. In such a scenario, many people are\nwashing their hands on a regular interval (Times of India,\n2020). It is a sanitary fight against an invisible virus and\nsources of infection. In such a scenario, OCD and related\nmaladaptive behaviors particularly due to consistent promotion of handwashing to mitigate the coronavirus infection\nand its spread is a serious concern. Besides mood-related\nand emotional outbursts especially panic, fear, avoidance\nand fear in meeting other people, fear of death\n(Thanatophobia), fear of getting isolated, stigmatization, fear\nof even not getting essential items, food, etc., may have its\npsychological manifestations. In many states, due to anxieties, people have been hoarding essential items which has\nled to shortages. Millions of People have lost their jobs.\nPeople employed in the informal and unorganized sectors\nare worst hit as they are struggling for, food, shelter and\ntheir livelihoods which created uncertainty leading to\ndepression, suicide, self-harm etc. The lockdown may be an\nimportant strategy to break the chain of transmission. But it\nhas also created boredom and monotony among office goers\nand children. In many households, children who end up\nstaying indoors become restless and, in some cases, violent.\nMany households have even closed windows and doors due\nto wrong notions regarding the infection.\nInterestingly the Coronavirus pandemic has another feature in this age of social media, where people are getting\noverloaded with rumors and misinformation which are not\nauthentic and verified. Such rumors and unauthenticated\ninformation create fear, anxiety, and stress with a sudden and\nnear-constant stream of news reports about an outbreak. In\nIndia, many people got exposed to positive people or to those\ntraveled abroad and who are at risk. However, they are not\ncoming forward for testing due to social stigma and social\nisolation. They are scared and fearful that they will be\nblamed, isolated and taken away from their family members.\nIt is important that these people receive counselling from\npsychologists and other mental health professionals that they\nhave not done anything wrong, and this is just a protocol to\nmitigate and control the pandemic. Their doubts need to be\nclarified; they deserve social and psychological support, counseling, compassion and kindness in such a distressful situation. Such stigma and social isolation have negatively\nimpacted HIV prevention in the past and we need to learn\nfrom that. The stigma associated with mental health problems may cause reluctance to seek support.\nTo date, over one hundred thousand people have died\nworldwide, and we do not know how many more will die\ndue to this pandemic. In such a scenario, providing psychosocial support and helping bereaved family members is\nimportant. Children may respond to stress in different ways\nsuch as being more clingy, anxious, withdrawing, angry or\nagitated, bedwetting, etc. Children need adults’ love and\nattention during difficult times. They need extra time and\nattention. It is important to keep children close to their\nparents and family and avoid separating children and their\ncaregivers to the extent possible. If separation occurs (e.g.\nhospitalization) regular contact (e.g. via phone) and reassurance are required (World Health Organization, 2020b).\nParticularly young children who have lost their parents are\nmore vulnerable. Every child experiencing such loss needs a\nsafe and supportive environment, guidance and help to\nexpress their feelings such as fear and sadness.\nJOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2020.1757052\nThe mental and psychological wellbeing of healthcare\nproviders is another concern. Healthcare providers are continuously working in fearful, stressful, resource constrained\nsettings where they are under the continuous threat of getting exposed and infected. In such a condition the healthcare providers’ mental health and psychosocial well-being\nare as important as managing the health of the infected\npopulation. The WHO has issued a thirty-one-point guidance for mitigating these problems. These include guidelines\nto safeguard the mental health of the population of different\nage groups affected with COVID-19 with a special focus on\nchildren, women and service providers, suggesting measures\nto mitigate anxiety, depression, and stigma, etc.\nThere are various resources available online which can be\nhelpful in managing and coping with the stress arising out\nof the pandemic. It is important for people to take care of\nthemself, their family members and friends. Helping others\nto cope with their stress makes the community stronger.\nNevertheless, the biggest challenge in mitigating mental\nhealth consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic is the lack\nof mental health professionals, practitioners, counselors, and\nhealth facilities where one can approach for such help. It is\ngoing to be a real challenge for a country like India where\nonly 0.29 Psychiatrists, 0.07 Psychologists, and 0.36 other\npaid mental health workers are available per 100,000 people\n(World Health Organization, 2018). In such a situation, it is\nimportant to evolve a simple counseling package that can be\ndelivered by givers at home or in the hospital. The package\nshould contain a number of dimensions, such as being\nempathetic and supportive to all those who are affected.\nThey need to be listened with compassion and kindness.\nEstablishing online mental health and counseling services at\nhospitals, community health care centres, and at university\ndepartments of psychology could be an opportunity to\naddress such a crisis (Liu et al., 2020).\nChina has been implementing emergency psychological\ncrisis interventions to reduce the negative psychosocial\nimpact on public mental health. However, challenges exist\n(Dong & Bouey, 2020). One can hope that States will learn\na lesson from this pandemic and recognize public mental\nhealth as an important priority area that needs to be formally integrated into public health preparedness and emergency response plans.",

Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong.\n\nMethod A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected.\n\nResult Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07).\n\nDiscussion Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus which caused unknown pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019 as “2019-nCoV”, which was renamed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as “SARS-CoV-2” on 11 February 2020. In parallel, the WHO formally named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as “COVID-19”, short for Coronavirus Disease 2019. Back in late December 2019, a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases associated with SARS-CoV-2 with a common link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market were reported [1], and the first death case attributable to SARS-CoV-2 occurred on 9 January 2020. Soon after the first global incidence was confirmed in Thailand on 12 January 2020, new cases were reported in different countries and were mostly associated with Wuhan travel history or residency. As of 20 February 2020, there have been 75465 confirmed cases in China, including 11633 severe cases and 2236 deaths [2]. In Hong Kong, the number of confirmed cases has risen to 68 on 20 February 2020 since the first local detection on 23 January 2020 [3].\n\nHealth officials have enacted interventions to slow transmission. In Hong Kong, adopted strategies include: border screening (measuring body temperature, imposing a health declaration form system, imposing a 14-day mandatory quarantine period on all individuals entering Hong Kong from the Mainland), social-distancing (border shutdown, reducing cross-border commuting services, deferring class resumption for schools governed by the Education Bureau, home-office arrangement for civil servants, suspension of public services from the Leisure and Cultural Services Department) and extending the Enhanced Laboratory Surveillance Program to adult patients with fever and mild respiratory symptoms presenting at accident and emergency departments or general out-patient clinics under the public sector.\n\nTo control this COVID-19 epidemic, much effort has been paid to identifying the etiological agent, epidemiological parameters such as incubation period [4], disease transmissibility [4, 5], clinical characteristics [6, 7], treatment options [8, 9], and route of transmission [10]. Although these information help devise optimal infection control strategies, such as contact tracing and follow-up isolation [11], they center purely on the mechanistic aspect of the disease.\n\nThe host’s behaviors are important for outbreak management, particularly during the early phase when no treatment or vaccination is available and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only options. The efficacy of NPIs depends on the host’s degree of engagement and compliance in precautionary behaviors, such as wearing masks, hand hygiene and self-isolation. Whether individuals voluntarily engage in precautionary behaviors depends on their risk perception towards the current health threat. In fact, risk perception is a main theme in common health behavior theories, including Health Belief Model and Protection Motivation Theory. In addition, with advanced information technology in recent years comes the uncertainty of how risk perception is shaped by various information sources. Hong Kong’s past experience with outbreaks of novel pathogens (2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and 2009 Pandemic Influenza) also provides a reference point to evaluate the risk perceptions of the current COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nIn light of the importance of host behavior in mitigating transmission and the vision to inform policy formation in a timely manner, this study aims to examine risk perceptions and behavioral responses of the general community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. Considering the rapid development of the epidemic during the survey period and the potential variability in the adoption of preventive measures among hosts, this study also examines the temporal changes in anxiety, the factors associated with adoption of preventive measures and their sources of information gathering.\n\nMETHODS\nSubject recruitment\nA cross-sectional online survey was conducted within 36 hours after the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Hong Kong. To ensure good coverage of the general community in Hong Kong, chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of all eighteen district councils and all individual councilors of the 452 District Council Constituency Areas (DCCAs) were approached by electronic mails and their contact numbers listed in the District Council websites (https://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/index.html) for survey dissemination. District councilors were invited to share our survey link and promotion messages on their webpages, social media platforms or any channels which they usually use to convey information to their targeted residents, but in general there was no restriction on their dissemination. Individuals who were aged 18 or above, understood Chinese and lived (on average) over five days per week in Hong Kong in the last month are eligible to participate. Respondents were compensated with a HKD10 cash coupon if they indicated willingness for receipt. To avoid duplicated responses from the same respondent, the survey could only be taken once from the same electronic device.\n\nRespondent characteristics\nRespondents were asked about their demographics (including sex, age, living district, education attainment, household income), self-perceived health status, travel history in the past month, occurrence of respiratory symptoms in the past fourteen days and anxiety level using the Hospital, Anxiety and Depression scale - Anxiety (HASD-A) (0-7 = Normal; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal; 11-21 = Abnormal). Although HADS-A is intended for screening clinically significant anxiety symptoms in clinical populations, many studies have showed that it is valid for community populations [12, 13], including employees [14], general population aged 65-80 years in Sweden [15], an Italian community sample aged 18-85 years [16]. As a complementary measure, the state anxiety level of a subset of respondents was assessed with the validated State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).\n\nRisk perception\nRisk perception towards COVID-19 was measured by two psychological dimensions: (i) perceived susceptibility, and (ii) perceived severity. The first dimension was proxied by how likely one considered oneself (his/her families) would be infected with COVID-19 if no preventive measure was taken. The second dimension was proxied by how one rated the seriousness of symptoms caused by COVID-19, their perceived chance of having COVID-19 cured and that of survival if infected with COVID-19. Subjects were also asked to rate the relative severity of COVID-19 compared with common non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and previous outbreaks by novel pathogens in Hong Kong. Responses were captured with a five-point Likert scale.\n\nInformation exposure\nRespondents were asked about the sources from which they obtained information about COVID-19, and how much they trust those sources. They were also asked about the types of information that they wanted to receive.\n\nPreventive measures\nRespondents were asked whether they performed precautionary measures and what their perceived efficacy of those measures are. Three types of precautionary measures were considered: hygienic practices, social distancing and travel avoidance.\n\nEthics consideration\nThis study has been approved by the Survey and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nPatient and Public Involvement Statement\nIt was not appropriate or possible to involve patients or the public in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFrequency and proportions of responses were tabulated. Demographics of respondents were compared to the 2016 population by-census in Hong Kong with Cohen’s w effect size (small: 0.1; medium: 0.3; large: 0.5) [17]. Regression models were used to test for temporal change in anxiety level and to identify factors associated with greater adoption of social-distancing preventive measures. The latter is proxied by adopting five or more social-distancing precautionary measures. Variables that appears to be associated (p<0.2) in the univariate analysis are considered in the multivariate analysis. The final model is determined by stepwise selection. Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) are estimated. Candidate variables include: demographics of respondents, self-perceived health status, travel history and anxiety level. A statistical significance of 0.05 was specified. Analysis was performed in R.\n\nRESULTS\nThe survey was conducted from 24 January 2020 to 13 February 2020 (Figure 1). Our survey period covers important clinical incidences, including first local death case and first overseas death case (Philippines), and social incidences, including healthcare workers on strike to call for entire border shutdown. It was also amid of the start-up of large-scale social-distancing interventions, including halt of sales of high-speed rail tickets to and from Wuhan, closure of public cultural and leisure facilities and deferral of school resumption. Meanwhile, alongside the launch of this survey was the escalating official threat tone on COVID-19: The WHO declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern, with Hong Kong activated the emergency response level.\n\nFigure 1.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nLaboratory confirmed cases and chronology of major events of COVID-19\n\nAbbreviations: China (CN); Hong Kong (HK); International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV); the Philippines (PH); the United States (US); World Health Organization (WHO)\n\nRespondent characteristics\nComplete data from 1715 respondents were analyzed. Table 1 shows the demographics of respondents. Many of the respondents are female (69%; 1176/1715), of young age (18-44 years) (80%; 1380/1715), working population (68%; 1168/1715). The study sample is comparable to the population in terms of residential district (effect size=0.27). Table 2 shows the background health conditions and travel history of respondents. The majority perceived their health status as good or very good (78%; 1331/1715), a quarter of them experienced respiratory symptoms in the past 14 days (423/1715) and travelled outside Hong Kong in the previous month (408/1715). Among the 408 respondents who were abroad, at least 24% of them (96-109) went to the Mainland China excluding Macau.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 1.\nRespondent characteristics\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 2.\nBackground health conditions and travel history of respondents\n\nRisk perception\nTable 3 shows the perceived susceptibility and perceived severity towards COVID-19 among respondents. Most respondents regarded themselves as likely to be infected with COVID-19 (very likely/likely: 89%), and most considered the symptoms of COVID-19 (if infected) as serious (very serious/serious: 97%). Less than a quarter of the respondents thought that it was likely to have COVID-19 cured (if infected) (15%), and only 18% thought that it was likely to survive through COVID-19. When referencing to existing diseases (Table 4), almost all respondents (>98%) consider equivalent disease severity between COVID-19 and SARS. This magnitude was similar to other deadly NCDs (85%-94%), but much higher than the annual seasonal influenza (66%).\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 3.\nRisk perception of the community towards COVID-19\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 4.\nComparison of disease severity\n\nMost respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%; 1667/1715), and they claimed that their daily routines were slightly (42%; 727/1715) or greatly (56%; 955/1715) disrupted. The average HADS-A score is 9.01 (95% CI: 8.44, 9.59); while the average score of state anxiety by STAI, from 804 complete responses, is 2.00 (95% CI: 1.46, 2.55).

The next two most trusted sources were broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were used by less than 40% of the respondents. On the other hand, the two most common information sources were social platforms (94%; 1608/1715) and websites (regardless of official or unofficial) (90%; 1539/1715), but they were rated as reliable or very reliable by only 26% and 16%-23% of the respondents respectively.

For social-distancing measures, although they were considered useful in preventing COVID-19 (very effective/effective: 70%-93%), their actual adoption was lower (range: 39%-88%).\n\nFigure 4.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 4.\nPerceived efficacy and actual adoption of precautionary measures to prevent transmission and contracting COVID-19\n\nTable 6 shows the regression analysis results for greater adoption (five or more) of social-distancing interventions during the early phase of this COVID-19 epidemic.

Despite disease uncertainty (including transmissibility, route of transmission and pathogenicity) at the early stage, individuals in the community had high perceived risk towards COVID-19 at large, viz: high perceived susceptibility and high perceived severity. A slightly increasing general anxiety level was observed over the three-week study period. Enhanced personal hygiene and travel avoidance were adopted by nearly all respondents, higher propensity of adopting greater degree of social-distancing measures were associated with being female, living in the NT, perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 well, work status except students and being more anxious.\n\nOur results have several immediate and significant public health implications. First, our results provide the baseline psychological and behavioral responses of the community against which current infection control strategies fit in. With the high perceived risk and large proportion of individuals adopting preventive measures in the community at the beginning, during which the accumulated number of local cases is 68 (as of 21 February 2020) with a significant initial portion of them being imported cases [18], we have an edge to block local transmission. This suggests that efforts to curb imported cases were efficient at the early phase of this outbreak. Following the recent enactment of a 14-day quarantine period for individuals entering Hong Kong from the mainland China, and the emergence of clustered local cases [19], the next important strategy on the agenda is to stabilize the supply of preventive materials, such as masks, so that the blockage of local transmission chain can be sustained. This is particularly important during the 24-day incubation period [20] associated with an elevated influx of individuals from the Mainland to Hong Kong between the announcement date (5 February 2020) and the effective date (8 February 2020) of the 14-day quarantine policy, and the recent emergence of super-spreaders to speed up local transmission.\n\nSecond, our results reveal the risk perception in the community, which is an important piece of information to enhance epidemic control [21]. Although the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic is Wuhan, the perceived risk of the community in Hong Kong was high. For emotional status, the HADS-A score in our survey (9.01) suggests that the community was borderline abnormal in terms of anxiety. Despite the slight difference in the inclusion of measurement items, the community was seemingly more anxious about the current COVID-19 epidemic (mean STAI score=2.00) than the 2009 pandemic influenza (mean STAI score = 1.8) [22], but was less worried than the SARS outbreak in 2003 (mean STAI score = 2.24) [23]. The significant time trend associated with HADS-A (Figure 2) suggests that the community became more and more anxious as new cases and new incidences came up (Figure 1).\n\nThird, our results suggest an alternative strategy for better risk communication. The large proportion of respondents were alert to COVID-19 (99.5%) or actively searching for related information (83%) highlighted the role of social media in shaping risk perception and epidemic-related emotion. It is particularly important amid of much disease uncertainty as mass scares can be triggered easily. Considering the high level of trust given by respondents to doctors and the low level of trust to the two most frequently used information sources, social platform and websites, health officials can collaborate frequently with associations of medical doctors, and invite them to help propagating official information in more sociable channels. This strategy is deemed more acceptable by the community than relying solely on the official channel, given only 16% of respondents rates official websites as reliable or very reliable. Our results also shortlisted information preferred by the community among an upsurge of disease-related information during the early stage (Table 5).\n\nFourth, our results pinpoint the drivers for greater level of adoption of social-distancing precautionary measures. In line with literatures that being female and an elevated anxiety level prompted compliance of precautionary measures [23, 24], we also identified similar association in this survey (Table 6). Interestingly, specific to this COVID-19 epidemic, residents in the NT were more likely to comply with social-distancing precautionary measures than their counterparts in other areas of Hong Kong.\n\nSeparating Hong Kong and the Guangdong Province are two busiest custom borders, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau [19], such that the residents in NT may consider themselves at greater risk of infection. Those who claimed they understood COVID-19 were more likely to adopt preventive measures, suggesting mass promotion of knowledge about COVID-19 in the community can boost uptake of precautionary measures. On the other hand, the less propensity to adopt precautionary measures among individuals who left Hong Kong in the previous month or who regularly visited China reinforces the need for border screening and for promoting social hygiene amid of epidemic times.\n\nFifth, this local study has profound implication to overseas countries undergoing the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. The WHO European region has been accumulating COVID-19 cases, but in only two days (22-24 February 2020), the number of laboratory-confirmed cases in Italy has risen from 17 to 219 [25]. Recently on 24 February 2020, the Ministry of Health announced the first COVID-19 case in Iraq. The presence of initial cases, aligning with the human-to-human [26] and asymptomatic [27] transmission, suggest that many countries may experience the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic soon. Results of this survey serve as a reference for overseas health officials to better prepare their containment strategies and handle the potential mass scares in their community.\n\nThis study has two strengths. First, it started within 36 hours after the detection of first local cases. This early start enables timely assessment of the community responses such that there is sufficient gap period to inform intervention policies. Second, our recruitment method, online survey via dissemination by DCCA councilors, is the first of its kinds to capture responses during public holidays while maintaining good geographical representation. The COVID-19 epidemic was amid of the Chinese New Year holidays and a series of large-scale social-distancing interventions enacted by Hong Kong government, particularly the home-office arrangement for employees. Therefore, the conventional random digit dialing approach adopted in the past local outbreaks [22, 23, 28] was not possible. And the involvement of all 452 DCCA councilors allows a thorough representation of every district in Hong Kong in the absence of a universal email database.\n\nThis study has two limitations. First, with an online approach, responses of those without internet access, particularly the oldest age group (55 years or above), were under-represented. Despite this, online surveys were the only feasible means of data collection during outbreak times. Second, this survey was conducted during the early phase that temporal variations of responses are not captured as the epidemic progresses. However, contact information were collected from this study cohort and follow-up surveys will be carried out as the disease progresses.\n\nTo conclude, we identified high risk-perception towards COVID-19 in the community, with the anxiety level higher than pandemic influenza but lower than SARS. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression of COVID-19, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied biological and mechanistic aspects of COVID-19, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent intervention and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.\n\nData Availability\nThe data will be available in github when it is officially published\nBackground Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong.\n\nMethod A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected.\n\nResult Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07).\n\nDiscussion Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus which caused unknown pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019 as “2019-nCoV”, which was renamed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as “SARS-CoV-2” on 11 February 2020. In parallel, the WHO formally named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as “COVID-19”, short for Coronavirus Disease 2019. Back in late December 2019, a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases associated with SARS-CoV-2 with a common link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market were reported [1], and the first death case attributable to SARS-CoV-2 occurred on 9 January 2020. Soon after the first global incidence was confirmed in Thailand on 12 January 2020, new cases were reported in different countries and were mostly associated with Wuhan travel history or residency. As of 20 February 2020, there have been 75465 confirmed cases in China, including 11633 severe cases and 2236 deaths [2]. In Hong Kong, the number of confirmed cases has risen to 68 on 20 February 2020 since the first local detection on 23 January 2020 [3].\n\nHealth officials have enacted interventions to slow transmission. In Hong Kong, adopted strategies include: border screening (measuring body temperature, imposing a health declaration form system, imposing a 14-day mandatory quarantine period on all individuals entering Hong Kong from the Mainland), social-distancing (border shutdown, reducing cross-border commuting services, deferring class resumption for schools governed by the Education Bureau, home-office arrangement for civil servants, suspension of public services from the Leisure and Cultural Services Department) and extending the Enhanced Laboratory Surveillance Program to adult patients with fever and mild respiratory symptoms presenting at accident and emergency departments or general out-patient clinics under the public sector.\n\nTo control this COVID-19 epidemic, much effort has been paid to identifying the etiological agent, epidemiological parameters such as incubation period [4], disease transmissibility [4, 5], clinical characteristics [6, 7], treatment options [8, 9], and route of transmission [10]. Although these information help devise optimal infection control strategies, such as contact tracing and follow-up isolation [11], they center purely on the mechanistic aspect of the disease.\n\nThe host’s behaviors are important for outbreak management, particularly during the early phase when no treatment or vaccination is available and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only options. The efficacy of NPIs depends on the host’s degree of engagement and compliance in precautionary behaviors, such as wearing masks, hand hygiene and self-isolation. Whether individuals voluntarily engage in precautionary behaviors depends on their risk perception towards the current health threat. In fact, risk perception is a main theme in common health behavior theories, including Health Belief Model and Protection Motivation Theory. In addition, with advanced information technology in recent years comes the uncertainty of how risk perception is shaped by various information sources. Hong Kong’s past experience with outbreaks of novel pathogens (2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and 2009 Pandemic Influenza) also provides a reference point to evaluate the risk perceptions of the current COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nIn light of the importance of host behavior in mitigating transmission and the vision to inform policy formation in a timely manner, this study aims to examine risk perceptions and behavioral responses of the general community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. Considering the rapid development of the epidemic during the survey period and the potential variability in the adoption of preventive measures among hosts, this study also examines the temporal changes in anxiety, the factors associated with adoption of preventive measures and their sources of information gathering.\n\nMETHODS\nSubject recruitment\nA cross-sectional online survey was conducted within 36 hours after the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Hong Kong.

The impact of this crisis is even higher in emerging economies like India due to already slowing growth rates, poor health infrastructure, and a significant population living in extreme poverty. While the government is taking measures to handle this crisis, nobody can be sure if these measures are adequate, as this will depend on how soon the spread of the virus is contained in the country. However, understanding the depth of the impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on the Indian economy is vital to formulate the policy and measures to contain this economic impact. This paper attempts to understand the impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on the Indian economy by employing a qualitative research design, based on sentiment analysis to understand 15 industry experts' opinion concerning the socio‐economic impact of COVID‐19. The study makes a theoretical as well as applied contribution to the field of study. While theoretically, it contributes to the field of pandemic research, public health management, and disaster management; in an applied sense, we propose a set of measures for the policymakers based out in India, as well as in other emerging nations of the world.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe outbreak of pandemics has conventionally been leaving a lasting impact on the global economy. Since the early twentieth century, pandemics like the Spanish Flu (1918–1920), Asian Flu (1957–1958), H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic (2009–2010), West African Ebola epidemic (2014–2016), Zika Virus epidemic (2015‐present day), and the recent COVID‐19 pandemic (2010‐present day) have not only resulted in the loss of human lives but also distressed economies (The Economist, 2020a). The immediate effect of the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic can be seen on service‐based businesses (O'Dea, 2020; The Economist, 2020a), and informal economy (Chandrasekhar & Ghosh, 2020) leading to a sharp spike in unemployment (International Labour Organisation, 2020). COVID‐19 pandemic has emerged at a time when the global economy is more interconnected than ever before. This interconnectedness has not only led to a rapid spread of the virus across the globe but has also triggered a chain reaction of economic disruptions (The Economist, 2020d). While manufacturers and retailers are receiving fewer orders and are subsequently forced to opt for production cuts, the banking sector is facing stressed loans (Buehler et al., 2020; The Economist, 2020c), and the workforce around the world is staring at job losses. The oil industry is also greatly affected due to reduced demand in the global markets (Dunn & Sherman, 2020). However, certain sectors like tourism, restaurants, and aviation are suffering the most due to lockdowns in different countries and reduced public movement (Krader & Vines, 2020; Suneson, 2020; World Tourism Organisation, 2020). With lockdowns emerging as the only way to contain the speed of spread of the virus, the world faces a tough dilemma of saving lives through lockdown, which is bound to create havoc for the livelihoods. Loss of lives and the preventive measure of lockdown have a significant impact on the global economy, and its financial aftershocks may even worsen with time. Though the mortality rate of patients affected by COVID‐19 is low as compared with other epidemics in the past, its impact on the economies is high in the present globalized world (World Economic Forum, 2020a). COVID‐19 pandemic is expected to cut the global GDP growth rate by 1.5% (Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development, 2020).\n\nThe impact of this crisis may even be higher in emerging economies like India due to already slowing growth rates, poor health infrastructure, and a significant population living in extreme poverty. The spread of COVID‐19 has exacerbated the Indian economy, which was already in perils, mainly due to slowing domestic demand and external factors like the US–China trade war (Goyal, 2020). So much so that Moody's had to cut its GDP forecast for 2020 for India to 2.5% (as against 5.3% projected barely 10 days ago) (Business Today, 2020). The immediate shocks from the lockdown during the COVID‐19 pandemic include the collapse of the informal sector in India, which employs nearly 80% of the country's employed population. To tackle with this unprecedented challenge, the government of India announced a relief package to the tune of 1% of the country's GDP, reduced interest rates, extended realization period of export proceeds, loans and EMIs, and reduced the CRR. While the government and central bank are taking these measures to handle this crisis, nobody can be sure if these measures are adequate and effective, as this will depend on how soon the spread of the virus is contained in the country. However, understanding the depth of the impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on the Indian economy is vital to formulate the policy and measures to contain this economic impact.\n\nThe response to COVID‐19 pandemic requires a coordinated effort like in any other disaster. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies defines disaster as “a sudden, calamitous event that seriously disrupts the functioning of a community or society and causes human, material, and economic or environmental losses that exceed the community's or society's ability to cope using its own resources” where Disaster = (Vulnerability + Hazard)/ Capacity (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, 2020). UN Chief called COVID‐19 pandemic as the most challenging crisis since WW‐II (Press Trust of India, 2020). India also declared COVID‐19 outbreak as a notified disaster (Hindustan Times, 2020) and aims to systematically respond to this pandemic calling its response so far as pro‐active, pre‐emptive, and graded (Times Now, 2020).\n\nThis paper attempts to understand the impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on the Indian economy by analyzing the interviews of policymakers and experts on the Indian economy. The systematic response of the policymakers to keep the economy afloat may be studied by segregating these interviews in seven themes; (a) Current economic measures taken by the government, (b) Fiscal policy decisions and stimulus package, (c) Global outlook and challenges, (d) GST‐related measures, (e) Industry‐specific measures, (f) Long‐term economic impacts of COVID‐19 pandemic, and (g) Impact on small businesses and daily wagers. Through a qualitative analysis of these interviews, we attempt to assess their responses on the fiscal and monetary space for handling this crisis; measures implemented or planned; India's response in comparison with developed countries; and long‐term effects of COVID‐19 pandemic on the Indian economy. Our research questions pertain to the following–\nWhat is the sentiment of the economic experts about the impact of COVID‐19 on the Indian economy?\nWhat are the fiscal policy, monetary policy, GST, and other economic measures required to manage the challenge being faced by the Indian economy from COVID‐19?\nWhat strategies and measures should be adopted to deal with the economic challenges concerning the small and medium‐sized enterprises, daily wage earners, migrant workers in India?\nWhat measures must be adopted by the developing nations to tackle the global challenges across the industries, including trade, aviation, tourism, hospitality, and so forth?\nWhat are the long‐term policies and measures required to deal with the post‐COVID crisis?\nThe paper is organized as follows. The present section introduces the study and formulates the research questions; the second section summarizes the existing literature on economic impacts of COVID‐19; the third section outlines the methodology used for this study; the fourth section presents the results and analysis; the fifth section discusses the findings vis‐à‐vis available literature; the sixth section presents policy implications; and the seventh section concludes.\n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe COVID‐19 outbreak is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS‐CoV‐2 virus that first manifested in December 2019 in Wuhan city in Hubei province of China (The World Health Organisation, 2020). The virus has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 other countries, including South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, France, Italy, Germany, and the USA (The Economist, 2020b; Thompson, 2020). While the cases in China reported a drop for the fourth consecutive day on 29 March 2020 (France 24, 2020), cases from other countries continued to rise despite more robust medial standards and practices (The Economist, 2020a). The outbreak revived the memories of a similar previously known virus, namely, 2019‐nCoV (SARS), which started from Guangdong province of China and went on to generate cases in 37 countries between 2002 and 2003 (Smith, 2006). However, SARS was then controlled, but the potential evolution of coronavirus is still not well understood (Cohen & Normile, 2020; M. D. Wang & Jolly, 2004). Amidst the significant public health risk being posed by COVID‐19 to the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern and pronounced COVID‐19 as a global pandemic (WHO, 2020).\n\nResearch, based on the surveillance and control of infectious diseases, as well as their impact on economic development has recently gained momentum (Brahmbhatt & Dutta, 2008). This attention is further restored by the emergence of many new infectious diseases namely—severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and H5N1 subtype influenza A, that are anticipated to continue emerging; anti‐biotic resistant bacterial infections including tuberculosis and methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); zoonoses such as SARS, avian influenza, and Lyme disease; HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and epidemic plant diseases such as cassava mosaic virus and banana blight (King, Peckham, Waage, Brownlie, & Woolhouse, 2006).\n\nGlobalization increases the chances of infectious diseases to spread from one country to the other (The Economist, 2020a). With strong connectivity across the globe, the impact of the disease goes beyond the conventional mortality (the ones who die) or the morbidity (those who are incapacitated or caring for the incapacitated and unable to work for a period). There are many direct and indirect channels through which an infectious disease outbreak influences the economy, but such economic effects do not fit into the standard approach of measuring the economic costs of disease (McKibbin & Fernando, 2020). To highlight such scenarios, Brahmbhatt and Dutta (2008) outline the “cost of illness” approach, which focusses on the opportunity cost of resources that are either consumed during medical care and treatment such as hospital fees, physician and nurses services, medicines, etcetera (direct costs); or the present or future cost to the society for morbidity, disability, or loss of output due to reduced productivity or workers' death (indirect costs). Economic analysis based on this approach is adopted by Meltzer, Cox, and Fukuda (1999), who evaluate the possible monetary estimates of an influenza epidemic in the United States, and opine that the highest economic cost is due to death and that people of age 65 years and above, should be vaccinated first. However, most of the studies have attempted to evaluate the economic effects of widespread infectious diseases based on private and non‐private medical costs associated with the disease or the demographic consequences of the epidemic (Lee & McKibbin, 2004), while in many cases, the costs of the disease are given without context, and with little use of appropriate denominators, making the analysis less reliant and valuable (Rich & Niemi, 2017). The standard neoclassical growth model suggests that a decrease in the population growth leads to a faster accumulation of capital, which further strengthens and increases the output growth of the country (Lee & McKibbin, 2004). For instance, Brainerd and Siegler (2003) evaluate the economic impact of the 1918–1919 Spanish influenza epidemic that killed 40 million people worldwide and 675,000 people in the United States and conclude that the epidemic is positively correlated with the subsequent economic growth in the United States. On the contrary, Bloom and Mahal (1997) find an insignificant impact of the 1918–1919 influenza epidemic on acreage sown per capita in India. Haacker (2002) evaluates the impact of HIV/AIDS in South African countries and opine significant negative impact on per capita income growth, mainly through its effect on human capital. The conventional approach of calculating the associated economic costs misses out on measuring the real economic costs of the disease that are highly contagious and for which there is no vaccine (McKibbin & Fernando, 2020).\n\nIn recent years, there have been numerous outbreaks of livestock and crop diseases, costing billions of euros to individual countries (King et al., 2006). For instance, Y. H. Wang, Yang, and Chen (2013) evaluate the infectious diseases namely enterovirus 71, dengue fever, SARS, and H1N1 that affect Taiwan's biotechnology industry over recent times and indicate a significant effect on the research and development ratios, current ratios, and assets of the company; Pham et al. (2017) examine the financial impacts of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), foot and mouth disease (FMD), and epidemic diarrhea between 2014 and 2014 in Vietnam and find that the losses per pig holding due to foot and mouth disease are 19, 25 and 32% of gross margin of pig holding in a large farm, fattening farm, and smallholder, respectively; and E. Bloom, Wit, and Carangal‐San Jose (2005) evaluate the consequences of avian influenza (H5N1) on Taiwan's macroeconomy and industries and conclude that, if the disease becomes a human‐to‐human pandemic, then it may impact the real GDP by −4.2 to −5.9%.\n\nThe outbreak of SARS, which started from Guangdong province of China between 2002 and 2003, infected some 10,000 individuals, killing around 1,000 people, which are quite low (M. D. Wang & Jolly, 2004), and also led to a very disproportionate economic impact (Smith, 2006). Sander et al. (2009) examine the potential impact of pandemic influenza in the United States and conclude that in the absence of any intervention, there is an economic impact of $187 per capita as a loss to society. M. D. Wang and Jolly (2004) compile the epidemiological evidence on SARS breakout and conclude that higher mortality rates are found in the regions where hospitals played a significant source of transmission. The experience from these previous disease outbreaks provides valuable insights that may assist in developing corrective measures to eradicate COVID‐19.\n\nOver the second half of 2019, and before the outbreak of COVID‐19, India's economy was already sputtering with slow growth to 4.7% last year. Further, the unemployment was at a 45‐year high, and the Indian industrial output for eight core sectors fell by 5.2% last year (Mukharji, 2020). The COVID‐19 shock has changed the scenario, with all the forecasts for 2020 being revised downwards, for instance, India Ratings and Research has cut India's GDP forecast to 3.6% from 5.5% for the financial year 2020–2021 (Kumar, 2020), and Moody's further cut its GDP forecast for 2020 for India from 5.3% projected earlier to 2.5% (Business Today, 2020). Despite the limited room for policies, there is a widely shared expectation that things would gradually improve in 2020, led by the broad set of emerging economies, with a return to potential global growth by 2021 (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2020). The gap between the reality on the ground, calling for bold and concentrated policy measures, and a persistent belief in a self‐correcting world economy, stigmatized suggestions of a need for more impactful policy interventions, instead of conceding to monetary tweaking and “structural reforms.” Former FBI governor Raghuram Rajan opines that economically, India is facing the greatest emergencies since independence and insists the government must consult people with proven expertise and capabilities, instead of relying on the overworked people from the Prime Minister's Office (The Economic Times, 2020).\n\nOur study makes a noble contribution to the body of knowledge in two ways. By answering our research questions as mentioned in the previous section of the paper, we firstly make a theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge in the field of public health management, pandemic research, and disaster management; and secondly, an applied contribution by informing the policymakers in India and other developing nations of the world for tackling this crisis.\n\n3 METHODOLOGY\nWe employ a qualitative research design, based on sentiment analysis to understand the industry expert's opinion concerning the economic impact of COVID‐19 and the measures that can be taken to prevent it. The qualitative data analysis software, (NVivo 12, QSR International) is used for processing and categorizing the opinions expressed during the interviews and live conferences conducted by the news agencies, business organizations, and other sources.\n\nFor the study, we referred to 15 semi‐structured interviews including three top‐level management officials namely, Dinesh Kanabar (CEO, Dhruva Advisors), Pawan Goenka (MD, Mahindra & Mahindra), and Vivek Gambhir (MD, CEO, Godrej Consumer Products); four economists namely, Pronab Sen, C Rangarajan, Robert Subbaraman and Swaminathan Aiyar; and seven current and former government officials namely, Nirmala Sitaraman (Finance Minister), Shaktikanta Das (RBI Governor), Raghuram Rajan (Former Finance Minister), P. Chidambaram (Former Finance Minister), Yashwant Sinha (Former Finance Minister), Rathin Roy (Former Economic Advisor), and R. Ramakumar (Kerela's Planning Board Member). For studying the economic impact of such a pandemic outbreak, the interviewees included for conducting this qualitative research, have considerable expertise and capabilities of dealing with such emergencies faced by the country, and hence, their responses may result in achieving more reliable and valid results. These interviews are dated from March 01, 2020 to March 31, 2020, specifically during the period when the pandemic started to spread at a faster pace in India. The content of all the interviews is evaluated and classified into seven common themes to facilitate their processing in NVivo, namely, fiscal policy and the stimulus package, industry‐specific measures, small business, and daily wagers, current economic measures, goods and services tax (GST) related measures, global outlook and challenges, and long‐term economic impacts.\n\nIn the interest of transparency and replicability, as advocated by Tranfield, Denyer, and Smart (2003), we provide some more detail into the procedure followed for analyzing the interviews. The interviews available in English are directly entered into the software, while the ones in other languages are transcribed in English before importing to the software. A word frequency query is run with the text to identify the frequently used words and phrases. The frequently used words and phrases from the interviewees' text are grouped to identify the words that are more important than others for the study. These words are analyzed for possible and frequent combinations. These combinations are further analyzed based on the comments surrounding the combinations to understand the context of the data, which is further categorized based on the combinations, and the positive and negative connotations are separated.\n\n4 FINDINGS\nWe begin by conducting a sentiment analysis of the interviews used for this paper. The sentiment analysis (Table 1 and Figure 1) suggests that most of the experts are very negative about the majority of the issues under study. Especially in terms of long‐term impacts, 52% of the respondents reflect negative opinions. The duration and depth of the crisis depend on how fast the virus spreads (which is also contextual with the lockdown period), how long before the vaccine is found, and how effectively the policymakers can mitigate the damage to the economic health and well‐being. The consensus view is that the shock has the potential to disrupt the otherwise well‐aligned global recovery that had set during late 2017 (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2020). Forty‐three percent of the experts have a negative opinion about the impact of COVID‐19 on small businesses and daily wage earners in India as the lockdown, and further quarantine measures have left the lower‐level workers and daily wage earners with no job and income (BBC News, 2020c), resulting in hundreds and thousands of migrant workers desperately trying to return to their hometowns (BBC News, 2020c). Additionally, the government's proposal in the form of an economic package of distributing free food and Rs. 500 per month to each account held by women is also criticized for being insufficient (Business Line, 2020a, 2020b). The opinion of the experts is also negative with respect to the economic measures (32% negative) and the economic stimulus (37% negative). Many commentators, including economists and high‐level corporate officials, are almost unanimous in suggesting the government to pen down and propose a more significant package focusing on the plight of the working class, and provide meaningful support to the already suppressed agriculture sector, which is also affected by the additional burden of reverse migration (Business Line, 2020a, 2020b). However, only in respect of the GST‐related measures, the responses and outlook appear moderately positive at 50%, confirming that though the fiscal measures require serious revisions, the measures pertaining to GST and related issues were quite appreciated. The government has already deferred the date for filing income tax returns from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020, while giving extension for filing GST returns for smaller companies (Mondal, 2020). Besides, the government has also relaxed the GST reconciliation obligation which may be a relief to the businesses (ET Contributors, 2020). However, industries, including tourism, hospitality, and aviation, are looking forward to enhanced measures, including further tax waivers (ET Contributors, 2020).\n\nTABLE 1.

Some estimates further suggest that 40–70% of the world's population could get infected (Baldwin & Mauro, 2020). The sentimental analysis hence, confirms the negative outlook reflective from the interviews with 38 and 41% negative opinion concerning the global outlook and industry‐specific measures, respectively. The prospects of the economy and the level of employment are decreasing rapidly. At the same time, the updated forecasts point to a significant negative impact on the global economy and reflect on growing signs of economic recession (International Labour Organisation, 2020). Additionally, the widespread of virus triggered containment measures, resulting in huge economic impacts on different industries including travel and tourism industry, entertainment and leisure sector, further hampering the global supply chains (Baldwin & Mauro, 2020), for instance, IATA estimates that aviation industry may face a loss of 29 billion US dollars of passenger revenues (IATA Economics, 2020).\n\nFurther in this section, we analyze the experts' interviews on the grounds as shown in Figure 2.\n\nimage\nFIGURE 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nManaging Indian socio‐economy in the wake of COVID‐19\nCOVID‐19 pandemic has ravaged the global economy and poses a risk to augment the current socio‐economic issues such as inequality, poverty, and gender disparity. India has been particularly affected severely due to an already slowing economy. It is, therefore, vital to understand how policymakers are planning to tackle this crisis effectively. The responses of the policymakers have been segregated into seven themes discussed further in this section.\n\nThe Indian government is working to revive the economy devastated by COVID‐19 pandemic by introducing a slew of monetary and fiscal policy measures. However, the stimulus package and cash transfers in India are not expected to be as large as in the western countries like the United States and Germany due to limited fiscal space. Besides, specific industries in India like tourism, hospitality, retail, and construction are affected more than the others. Hence, it is crucial to understand how these sectors will be kept afloat. India is also home to a large population involved in unorganized sector earning daily wages. These are the people who migrate to cities from their respective villages for better lives. Large scale reverse migration to villages from cities is seen during the lockdown in India casting a shadow over the livelihood of these individuals. Further, demand creation is an essential aspect of reviving the economy post‐COVID‐19 pandemic. Changes in taxation structure, particularly GST can out some extra money in the hands of people which is likely to prevent demand destruction. The COVID‐19 pandemic has also been tuff on globalization which was already affected by rising protectionism. While many countries including India are aiming to promote self‐reliance and localization, it shall be interesting to see how today's inter‐connected economies shall balance their country‐specific challenges vis‐à‐vis global challenges.\n\nLastly, the economic impact of COVID‐19 pandemic is expected to leave a long‐term impact due to major disruptions in almost all sectors of the economy. It is vital to analyze long‐term economic reforms apart from the stimulus package to mitigate the risk of a prolonged slowdown post‐COVID‐19.\n\n4.1 Fiscal policy and the stimulus package\nThe Indian government announced a $22.6 billion (around 1% of the GDP) economic stimulus package to provide direct cash transfers and food security measures to millions of poor people hit by a nationwide lockdown triggered by the coronavirus pandemic (CNBC Asia Economics, 2020). This proposal was put forth two days after a 21‐day nationwide lockdown was announced. However, with an intent to control the spread of the deadly virus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the 21‐day lockdown by additional 3 weeks up to May 03, 2020 (BusinessLine, 2020b), which further leads to the urgent need for the center to announce more robust fiscal measures. Many economists anticipate that the center will have to announce a much bigger financial package than the one earlier, of around $39 billion to address the needs of the vulnerable and affected segments of the economy (BusinessLine, 2020b).\n\nThe proposed financial package emphasizes on providing food security and direct bank transfers for poor households, and daily wage earners, who need immediate help (CNBC Asia Economics, 2020). It is evident from Figure 3 that the responses to the fiscal stimulus are least concentrated around the other industrial sectors and do not provide concrete measures to tackle problems faced by them, namely—exports, tourism, transportation, horticulture, retail, imports, crude oil, and fuel. The prominence of words such as health, hygiene, hungry, migrant, families, employees, and customer suggest that the government has focused more on the demand‐ and supply‐side issues. In terms of the demand side, consumption has got impacted due to the loss of jobs and a decline in income levels, whereas on the supply side, the disruptions in production have spread across the world. All businesses, regardless of size, are facing severe challenges, especially those in aviation, tourism, and hospitality industries with concurrent declines in revenue, insolvencies, and job losses (International Labour Organisation, 2020). Further, with widespread panic and fear, overall confidence of consumers has come down, leading to the postponement of buying decisions, which pulls the demand from sectors, including tourism, aviation, apparel, hospitality, and cinema industries (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry, 2020).\n\nimage\nFIGURE 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nFiscal policy and the stimulus package\n4.2 Industry‐specific measures\nTourism, hospitality, and aviation are among the worst affected sectors that are facing the maximum brunt of the present crisis (Business Standard, 2020). Closing of cinema theatres and declining footfall in shopping complexes have affected the retail sector by impacting the consumption of both essential and discretionary items (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry, 2020). Consumption is also getting impacted due to job losses and a decline in income levels of people, particularly the daily wage earners due to slowing activity in several sectors, including retail, construction, entertainment, and so forth (International Labour Organisation, 2020). On the supply side, the shutdown of factories and the resulting delay in the supply of goods from China has affected many Indian manufacturing sectors, which source their intermediate and final product requirements from China (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry, 2020). Some sectors like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, chemical products, etc. are facing an imminent raw material and component shortage. Specifically, with the closure of factories in China, the Indian pharmaceutical companies dependence on China for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) became a matter of concern for health security, and in such a case, the government encourages India's API manufacturers to expand capacity and promote pharmaceutical manufacturing hubs (Chatterjee, 2020).\n\nFrom Figure 4, growth seems to be the primary source of concern for the respondents. At the same time, jobs, debt, inflation, and innovation are other prominent factors to be taken into consideration while formulating policies to control the negative impact of the virus infection on specific industries. Moreover, health, hospitals, and medicine manufacturing are amongst the least discussed aspects (Figure 4), indicating that in the face of such pandemic, there is a need to support health and economic well‐being of the citizens and, it is crucial to prioritize health spending for medical equipment, and COVID‐19 testing; compensate doctors and nurses and further to make sure that the hospitals and clinics have enough protective resources to function effectively (PTI, 2020b). Innovation, which does not seem to be a concern from the ongoing discussions, can play a vital role in the form of artificial intelligence technology during this outbreak in every aspect, such as traffic management, infection detection, logistics supply chain, and so forth (Xu, Luo, Yu, & Cao, 2020).\n\nimage\nFIGURE 4\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nIndustry‐specific measures\n4.3 Small business and daily wagers\nThe crisis has already transformed into an economic and labour market shock, impacting not only production and supply of goods and services but also demand (consumption and investment) (International Labour Organisation, 2020). Travel bans, border closures, and quarantine measures have resulted in job‐less workers with no‐incomes (BBC News, 2020c). Sustaining business operations in such scenarios is particularly tricky, particularly for the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nAn Action Plan has been prepared by the G20 members to protect lives, safeguard people's jobs and incomes, restore confidence, preserve financial stability and help those countries",

Caraka et al.\nINTRODUCTION\nDisaster risk assessment is intended to provide\nmore detailed and precise information about the\npossibility of the object affected and the risks faced.\nBy knowing all of that, the agency responsible for\ndisaster management can make efforts for better\ndisaster management and more efficient planning\nand preparedness steps. Disaster management is a\nset of policies and administrative decisions and\noperational activities related to various stages of all\nlevels of disaster. A broader definition of humancreated disasters recognizes that human activity\ncauses all disasters because humans have chosen to\nbe in natural phenomena that cause adverse effects\non humans. Disasters can be seen as a series of\nphases of a time continum. Identifying and\nunderstanding these phases’ helps to describe the\nneeds associated with disasters and conceptualize\nadequate disaster management activities (Djalente et\nal., 2020) Reducing the number of fatalities and\nmaterial losses can be achieved, among others, by\nincreasing the community’s preparedness in facing\ndisasters. Preparedness causes the community to act\nquickly and appropriately in saving themselves and\ntheir assets from the impact of the disaster that\noccurs. Preparedness is one of the essential elements\nof disaster risk reduction activities that are pro-active\nbefore a disaster occurs. Preparedness of a\ncommunity is not always separated from aspects\nsuch as emergency response, recovery, reconstruction,\nand mitigation. Various pre-disaster preparation\nsteps are needed to ensure the achievement of a\ncertain level of preparedness. The implementation of\nemergency response activities and post-disaster\nrecovery can indicate the effectiveness of community\npreparedness. Disaster mitigation can be used as a\nbasis or guide in development planning and increase\ncommunity knowledge in dealing with and reducing\nthe impact of disasters so that people can live and\nwork safely. In principle, mitigation must be carried\nout for all types of disasters, including natural\ndisasters and natural disasters caused by human\nintervention and should be routine and sustainable\nactivities. However, the term mitigation in climate\nchange terminology differently in disaster terminology\n(Caraka et al., 2020). Mitigation in the terminology of\ndisasters is defined as an effort made to reduce\nimpacts and risks both by nature and humans. The\nterm mitigation in the terminology of disasters\nincludes adaptation. Orders are also responsible for\nequipping people with knowledge that is more\nenvironmentally friendly and disaster response\n(Kaban et al., 2019). Thus, the community will\nbecome better aware of how to respond and deal\nwith disasters at any time. Besides that, for the\ncommunity that utilizes natural resources to support\neconomic activities or private sector users to be more\nprudent in utilizing the availability of the environment\nfor economic activities, also pay more attention to\nenvironmental aspects that are balanced and well\nmaintained. In addition to taking such preventive\nmeasures, post-disaster revitalization measures must\nalso be taken of physical structures (damaged\nbuildings, injuries, and other forms of physical\nmaterial), social, psychological, and economic aspects\n(Kurniawan et al., 2018). Because of that, disaster\nmitigation also requires preparedness aspects of the\ncommunity. Previously, diseases as national disasters\nsuch as the Post-earthquake Zika virus Ecuador (Reina\nOrtiz et al., 2017), Chikungunya in India (Bhowmik, et\nal., 2010), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Whiley et al.,\n2012), Ebola virus (Siddle, et al., 2016). Disasters\ntriggered by natural hazards can strike at that\nmoment, with devastating consequences for humans,\ninfrastructure, assets, and the whole economy.\nMoreover, a pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) falls\ninto this category. Beyond its enormous health\nimpact, there are significant economic losses for\nhouseholds, companies and governments as well as a\nmassive disruption to life and livelihoods as a result\nof locking, supply chain disruptions, and a sharp\ndecline in commercial activity. The recommendations\nfor physical distancing issued by the Indonesian\ngovernment kept people at home and did not go out\nto do their usual activities. So that indirectly has a\nsignificant impact on environmental changes during\nthe lockdown. In line with this, The President of the\nRepublic of Indonesia established COVID-19 as a\nNational Disaster. ASEAN has actively reconvened and\nutilised its existing health regional mechanism to try\nto have a coherent response to the impacts (Djalante\net al., 2012). Therefore, (Djalante et al., 2020)\nrecommend the knowledge and science provision in\nunderstanding disaster and health-related emergency\nrisks and DRR in COVID-19. Table 1 represents the\ntravel advisory in ASEAN. The Indonesian government\nhas three times determined the status of a national\ndisaster, before the COVID-19 outbreak. Although \n67\nGlobal J. Environ. Sci. Manage., 6(SI): 65-84, Autumn 2020\nCOVID-19 is the only thing called a non-natural\ndisaster. First, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8\nin East Flores on December 12, 1992, killed 2,500\npeople and injured 2,103 people. On the same day,\nthe 1992 Flores tsunami was recorded killing 2,400\npeople in the Sikka region (Yeh et al., 1993). The\nstatus of the national disaster in the Aceh tsunami,\nwhich killed 130 thousand people. The earthquake\nand tsunami that occurred in 2004 practically crippled\nthe local government, so that the central government\ntook over the response (Rofi et al., 2006). Then Aceh\ntsunami occurred on December 20, 2004, and disaster\nmitigation was completed on April 11, 2012, with an\nevaluation of the existence of the tsunami evacuation\nbuilding in Aceh which was carried out after the\nearthquake magnitudes 8.6 and 8.2 magnitudes. This\nevaluation was carried out by LIPI in collaboration\nwith several parties. The outcomes of this study led\nto improvements mitigate tsunami disasters not only\nin Aceh but also in Indonesia. At the same time, April\n11, 2012 earthquake event also encouraged the\nGovernment of Indonesia to prepare a Master Plan\nfor the Indonesian Tsunami Disaster Management.\nHowever, The Lombok earthquake in July 2018 was a\nmagnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck the Indonesian\nisland of Lombok on July 29, 2018, at 06.47 WITA.\nAnd the worst 7 magnitudes in August 2018 (Pribadi\net al., 2020). At the end of December 2019 and early\n2020, the world was hit by an epidemic that claimed\nmore lives in a rapid and widespread time throughout\nthe world, starting from Wuhan China, which is later\nknown as COVID-19 (Whitworth, 2020). COVID-19\ncurrently is a type A, the most dangerous type and\ncan be deadly. The early coronavirus detection in\nsewage may represent a non-invasive warning\napproach to alert communities to new COVID-19\ninfections, given that most people will not be tested\n(Orive, et al., 2020).This disease also has a fast\nincubation period. In Indonesia, COVID-19 has been\ncategorized as a national disaster. Indonesia is the\nfourth most populous country in the world and\npredicted to be affected significantly over a longer\ntime period (Djalante et al., 2020). Determination of\nCOVID-19 as a national disaster is contained in\nPresidential Decree (KEPPRES) 12/2020 concerning\nDetermination of Non-Natural Disasters Spreading\nCorona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a National\nDisaster. Determination of national disaster status\nrefers to Law Number 24 the Year 2007 concerning\nDisaster Management. Article 7 paragraph 2 states\nthat a number of indicators determine the status and\nlevel of national and regional disasters. Among these\nare, the number of victims, property losses, damage\nto facilities and infrastructure, the extent of the area\naffected by the disaster, and the socio-economic\nimpacts caused. Then, the determination of the\nstatus of national disasters is also regulated in\nGovernment Regulation No. 21/2008 concerning the\nImplementation of Disaster Management. In this\nregulation, it is stated that the President has the\nFig 1: Indonesia national disasters from 1992 to 2020\nFig 1: Indonesia national disasters from 1992 to 2020\n68\nImpact of COVID-19 on environment and economy\nauthority to determine the status of national\ndisasters. Then it is necessary to pay attention to the\nGovernment Regulation in Lieu of Acts to implement\nthe provisions of Article 12 paragraph (21 Government\nRegulations in Lieu of Law Number I of 2020\nconcerning State Financial Policies and Financial\nSystem Stability for Handling the COVID-19 Pandemic\nand/or in the framework of Facing Threats that\nEndanger the National Economy and/or Financial\nSystem Stability, it is necessary to stipulate\nPresidential Regulation 54 of 2020 concerning\nChanges in Posture and Details of the State Budget\nfor the 2020.\nWhether realize it or not, lockdowns or large\nscale restriction regulations to prevent the spread\nof COVID-19 have an impact on the environment\nand also the economy (Isafan., 2020). DTR and\nhumidity might affect the mortality of COVID-19 in\nWuhan, which deserves further investigation from\na larger range of studying area (Ma et al., 2020). In\nIndia, PM2.5 had maximum reduction in most regions\n(Sharma et al., 2020). Also, The positive indirect\neffects revolve around the reduction of PM2.5 and\nNO2\n concentrations in China, France, Germany,\nSpain, and Italy (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020),\nBeside, AT parameter had a linear relationship with\nthe number of people afflicted with COVID-19 in\ndifferent provinces of Iran and that the transmission\nrate of coronavirus did not have a high sensibility to\nit (Jahangiri et al., 2020). Temperatures above 8 to\n10 °C were associated with decreased COVID-19 daily\nconfirmed cases rate (Shi et al., 2020).\nTable 1: Travel advisory ASEAN briefing\nCountry Notes\nBrunei ▪ Citizens and foreign residents in the country are banned from leaving the nation.

Restaurants and eateries that operate must comply with strict guidelines from local\nauthorities.\n▪ Taxis, buses, Grab services and inter-provincial transport have also resumed though with restrictions as per\nthe transport authorities.\n▪ Honda Vietnam announced that it would resume automobile and bike production from April 23.\nTable 1: Travel advisory ASEAN briefing\n69\nGlobal J. Environ. Sci. Manage., 6(SI): 65-84, Autumn 2020\nDuring COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, daily\ntemperature has the highest correlation with the\nnumber of cases. In other words, the lower the\ntemperature on a day, the higher is the number\nof COVID-19 cases on that day (Şahin, 2020). Also,\ntemperature average (°C) was significantly correlated\nwith COVID-19 in DKI Jakarta (Tosepu et al., 2020). There\nare reductions in PM10, SO2\n, and NO2\n concentrations\nduring the COVID-19 in Salé City (Morocco) (Otmani\net al., 2020). Related to the lockdown policy, it will also\nhave an impact on the economic side (Baldwin et al.,\n2020). Assessing the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic is essential for policymaker. Poverty kills\npoor people, but the outbreak of COVID-19 shows\nthat if diseases are generated in poor countries due\nto overcrowding, poor public health and interaction\nwith wild animals, these diseases can kill people of any\nsocioeconomic group in any society (McKibbin et al.,\n2020). Therefore, (Guerrieri et al., 2020) suggest the\noptimal policy to face a pandemic. Their suggestion is\na model which combines monetary policy loosening\nand abundant social insurance. Regarding the stock\nprice (Toda, 2020) predicts that the stock price\ndecreases by 50% during the epidemic, but recovers\nquickly afterwards because the epidemic is a shortlived labour supply shock. To accelerate recovery and\nminimize the impact of COVID-19 in Indonesia. The\nGovernment of Indonesia established the Coronavirus\nDisease Mitigation Acceleration Task Force by involving\nministries, institutions and other government units\nsuch as the Ministry of Health, the Indonesian National\nPolice, the Indonesian National Armed Forces, and\nregional governments. This research aims to analyze\nthe environmental and economic changes due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The environmental\nchange is examined from the condition of pollutant\ncomponents of CO, HCHO, NO2\n, and SO2\n from January\n01 to April 30, 2020. The time period covers the\nphases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in\nIndonesia. In order to narrow the focus of the study,\nthe study area of this research is five provinces with\nthe most confirmed COVID-19 cases (DKI Jakarta, West\nJava, East Java, Sentral Java, and South Sulawesi).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy area\nAfter the first confirmed case was found in DKI\nJakarta, within short period of time the capital\nof Indonesia became the COVID-19 epicenter.\nPopulation density, mobility and rapid aconomic\nactivites are the factors in increasing the cases.\nThe inter-census population survey, projects the\npopulation of DKI Jakarta in 2020 to increase by 72\nthousand to 10.57 million. West Java is geographically\nbordering with DKI Jakarta, several areas of West\nJava become satellite cities that support economic\nactivities in DKI Jakarta. East Java is the province with\nthe second largest gross regional domestic product\nin Indonesia after DKI Jakarta with Rp2.352.42\ntrillion (2019) with the manufacturing sector as the\nlargest GRDP contributor (30.24%). Central Java is\nlocated in the middle of Java Island, bordering with\nWest Java and East Java. The three provinces in Java\nIsland dominate around 46% of the total population\nin Indonesia. West Java with 49.570.000 population,\nEast Java with 39.960.000 population, and Central\nJava with 34.740.000 population. South Sulawesi is\na province on the Sulawesi Island, Indonesia with a\ntotal of 8.928.004 population.\nData collection\nIn this study, the differences of CO, HCHO, NO2\n,\nand SO2\n densities was measure in the five study\nareas. Then, Sentinel-5P used to get the data which\naccesed and extracted using Google Earth Engine.\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel5P) mission dedicated to perform atmospheric\nmeasurements with high spatio-temporal resolution,\nto be used for air quality, ozone & UV radiation,\nand climate monitoring & forecasting. The mission\nconsists of one satellite carrying the TROPOspheric\nMonitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument\n(European Space Agency, 2020). Google Earth Engine\nis a platform that can be used to access and analyze\ngeospatial datasets on a large scale (Gorelick et\nal., 2017). Then, employ the python API to make\nrequests to the Earth Engine servers. The data\ncollected is daily average of pollutant density during\nperiod the January 1 to April 30, therefore there are\nmissing values. Also, Impute the missing values using\ninterpolation techniques with R (R Core Team, 2008)\nand imputeTS package (Moritz et al., 2017). After\nthe data series is complete, the data is labelled and\nsplitted into two categories with the date of the first\nconfirmed case in Indonesia (March 2, 2020) as cut\noff: data until the first confirmed case and data after\nthe first confirmed case. Table 3 represents more\nclearly. Regarding the mobility analysis, the data used \n70\nR.E. Caraka et al.\nare from Apple and Google mobility report. In April,\nGoogle published mobility reports of every country,\nincluding Indonesia, which contains aggregated and\nanonymized mobility trend data from March to April\n2020. (Aktay et al., 2020) provide a full explanation\nof the data anonymization process. Similarly, Apple\nalso published its anonymized mobility data, yet\nno documentation is given to explain the of data\nanonymization process.\nData analysis\nDue to the small size of the data, Wilcoxon test\nwith an alpha significance level α = 5% by using\nEq. 1 is performed to test the differences. Wilcoxon\ncan also be used to compare the mean values of a\nvariable from two paired sample data.\n1 0\n, 1, 2, , 1 0\ni\ni\ni\nd\nW for i n d\n > =  = …\n− <\n1\n.\nn\ni i\ni\nT rd W =\n= ∑\n (1)\n\ni r d Explains the ranking value of the difference\nvalue i d which is then absolute. Wi Will be obtained\nfor the Wilcoxon marked rank test. To find the average\nWilcoxon ranking using Eq. 2.\n( ) ( 1)\n4\nn n E T + =\n\n( ) ( 12 1 )( )\n24\nnn n V T + + =\n( )\n( )\nT ET\nZ\nV T\n− =\n\n(2)\n\n\nThen, the significance level can be chosen from\n1% -10% depending on the researcher. For a two-side\ntest, H0 is accepted if 1 1\n2 2\n− << Z ZZ α α . For the right side,\nreject H0 if Z Z ≥ 1−α . For the left side, reject H0 if Z Z≤ 1−α\n. The value of −Z1−α and 1\n2\nZ α can be obtained from the\nstandard Z normal distribution table (Caraka et al.,\n2017). Then the associasion is measured using ODDS\nRatio. In brief, Odds Ratio (OR) is the probability of an\nevent occurring compared to the chance of an event\nnot occurring (Pardamean et al., 2018; Kurniawan et\nal., 2019). The probability of an event is symbolized\nby π and Eq. 3 represents the ODDS.\n1\nODDS π\nπ = −\nODDS (1− = π π ) (3)\nODDS ODDS = + π π( )\n1\nODDS\nODDS = π +\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nImpact on density of CO, HCHO, NO2\n, and SO2\ndensity\nIn this section, the analysis of COVID-19 impact\nis performed in several regions in Indonesia where\npublic activities limitation implemented. The density\nof CO, HCHO, NO2\n, and SO2\n are measured, respectively.\nAir pollution is defined when there are substances in\nthe air that significantly change the composition and\ncomposition of the air under normal conditions. The\npresence of these pollutants in the form of toxic gases\nand small particles is also called aerosols. Air polluted\nwith particles and gases can cause health problems\nthat vary with different level, and type, it depends on\nchemical composition. Determination of pollution or\nwhether an area of air based on the parameters in\nTable 2.\nAir pollution, both the spread and reaction of\npollutants, is influenced by aspects of topography,\ngeography and meteorology. In other words, the size\nof the environmental impact due to air pollution is\nclosely related to the local weather and climate or\nrelated to the direction and speed of the wind, air\ntemperature, humidity, rainfall, and solar radiation.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2\n) is one of the natural gases in the\nair(Caraka et al., 2019).. This gas has the characteristics\nTable 2: Parameters of air pollution (Leslie et al., 1994)\nParameters Clean air Polluted\nParticle Material 0.01-0.02 mg/m3 0.07-0.27 mg/m3\nSO2 0.003-0.02 ppm 0.02-2 ppm\nCO <1 ppm 5-200 ppm\nNO2 0.003-0.02 ppm 0.02-0.1 ppm\nCO2 310-330 ppm 350-700 ppm\nHydrocarbons 1 ppm 1-20 ppm\nTable 2: Parameters of air pollution (Leslie et al., 1994) \n71\nGlobal J. Environ. Sci. Manage., 6(SI): 65-84, Autumn 2020\nof non-toxic and colourless. Some experts claim that\nCO2\n is not a significant component of air pollution.\nHowever, based on the American Conference Limit\nValue (TLV), CO2\n at a concentration of 30.000 ppm can\ncause low-level poisoning, increased heart rate and\nrespiratory distress in humans, although it is difficult\nto find regions on earth with such concentrations.\nCO2\n also has the potential to affect humans at specific\nconcentrations negatively. After the first COVID-19\ncase was announced in Indonesia, the government\nimposed a large-scale social limitation, and DKI\nJakarta became the COVID-19 epicentre in Indonesia.\nThe Indonesia large-scale social restrictions policies\nin each city are different; at this stage, we analyze\nFig. 2: CO density January 2020- May 2020 in Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi.\nFig. 2: CO density January 2020- May 2020 in Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi.\nFig. 3: HCHO density January 2020- May 2020 in Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi\nFig. 3: HCHO density January 2020- May 2020 in Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi\n72\nImpact of COVID-19 on environment and economy\ncases in DKI Jakarta, Fig. 2 explains CO Density,\nFig. 3 explains HCHO Density, Fig. 4 explains NO2\nDensity, Fig. 5 explains SO2 density in Jakarta, East\nJava, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi,\nrespectively, after large-scale social restrictions is\napplied. For CO Density, since the first COVID-19 case\nwas announced in March, it was seen that there was\na significant decrease, but then it was significant in\nthe 3rd week of March. In early April, CO density\ndropped significantly. If we compare with the lowest\nCO point in the January-May period, in general,\nthere are no significant changes before and after\nFig. 4: NO2 density January 2020- May 2020 in Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi Fig. 4: NO2 density January 2020- May 2020 in Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi\nFig. 5: SO2 density January 2020- May 2020 in Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi Fig. 5: SO2\n density January 2020- May 2020 in Jakarta, East Java, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi\n73\nGlobal J. Environ. Sci. Manage., 6(SI): 65-84, Autumn 2020\nIndonesia large-scale social restrictions is applied.\nIn other cases, HCHO, NO2\n, and SO2\n also found no\nsignificant differences. However, HCHO can reach its\nlowest point in March, as well as NO2\n and SO2\n. If we\npay attention to the pattern of increase, then there is\nthe same relationship in each variable. For example,\nif SO2\n rises then HCHO, NCHO, CO, each also rises, and\nvice versa.\nTable 3 explains the Wilcoxon test, odds ratio,\nand the Fisher exact test. With a significance level of\nalpha α=5%, the Wilcoxon test shows that there are\nsignificant differences of NO2\n density in DKI Jakarta,\nWest Java, East Java, and South Sulawesi. The odd\nratio shows that West Java and East Java, with odd\nratios of 4.51 and 2.42 respectively, tend to have a\nhigher level of NO2\n density until the cut off dates.\nHowever, South Sulawesi tends to have a lower level\nof NO2\n density until the cut off date with an odds\nratio of 0.20. The Wilcoxon test shows that there\nare significant differences of HCHO density in DKI\nJakarta, East Java, and South Sulawesi. According to\nthe odds ratio, both DKI Jakarta (OR = 0.01) and Jawa\nTimur (OR=0.02) tend to have a lower level of HCHO\ndensity until each cut off dates.

Environ. Sci. Manage., 6(SI): 65-84, Autumn 2020\nhave significant differences of CO density, concluded\nfrom the Wilcoxon test. All of the regions also have\nodd ratios> 1, showing that all of the observations\ntend to have a higher level of CO density until the\ncut off dates. In contrast, both the Wilcoxon test\nand odd ratio show that there are no significant\ndifferences of SO2\n density nor any tendency in all of\nthe regions before and after each cut off dates.The\naverage ratio of formaldehyde concentrations in\noxidants was 21.22%. Apart from oxidant and ozone\ngas, the formation of formaldehyde is also influenced\nby several meteorological factors such as sunlight\nintensity. According (Haagen-Smit, 1959) sunlight will\nhelp hydrocarbons to react with Nox to form ozone\nand formaldehyde through photochemical reactions.\nIn other words, HC and NOx\n will react assisted by\nthe high intensity of the Sun so that from March\nto April, it feels hot in Jakarta. Regarding the PM2.5\npollution (Caraka et al., 2019), the increase of only\n1 𝜇g/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase\nin the COVID-19 death rate (95% confidence interval\n[CI]: 2%, 15%) (Wu et al., 2020). HCHO also hazardous\nair pollutant and inferring cancer risks (Zhu et al.,\n2017). This study expects that higher the HCHO will\nincrease the risk of contracting COVID-19. In line with\nthis, (Ogen, 2020) proof exposure to NO2 causes\ninflammatory in the lungs, it is now necessary\nto examine whether the presence of an initial\ninflammatory condition is related to the response of\nthe immune system to the coronavirus. At the same\ntime, (Pansini et al., 2020) do the correlation levels\nof air pollution with COVID-19 spread and mortality\nand they found a significant correlation which allows\nus to infer that leaving in an area with low air quality\nseems to be a risk factor for becoming infected and\ndying from this new form of coronavirus. Pollen in\nthe atmosphere increases general immune responses\nand are a casual factor reducing the spread of flu-like\nviruses (Barcelo, 2020).\n Finally, it should be noted again regarding the area\nof green open space in each area and also population\ndensity (Isaifan et al., 2018; Isaifan et al., 2020). In\nurban areas, green space has a very important role in\nthe supply of oxygen and cleaning dirty air. Therefore,\nif an area does not have enough green space, it will\nhave a negative impact on the environment and\nsurrounding communities. One effect of the lack\nof green open space in urban areas is the limited\namount of oxygen production that can be produced\nby green open space, so that pollutant gases are not\nabsorbed properly. The results also proves that there\nare no significant changes of SO2 density. In summary,\nthe Wilcoxon test, ODDS ratio and graph visualization\nprovide the same conclusions.\nMobility before and after Large scale restriction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has changed the pattern\nof population mobility, as can be seen in Fig. 6A\nThe large scale restriction policy makes a significant\ndifference in the pattern of population mobility to\nvisit markets, supermarkets, pharmacies, and retail\n(Ouhsine et al., 2020). However, Fig. 6B represents\nthere was a significant surge in population mobility\nvisiting supermarkets and pharmacies at the\nbeginning of March 2020. Fig. 6C represents resident\nmobility increased after the second week of March\n2020. The social distancing policy on population\nobstruction that can be found is only in the form of\nmovement of people within a limited geographical\nrange, or proximity, for example only in residential\nareas/neighborhoods, from residences to markets, to\nsuperm",

Here we employ a spatially explicit model, properly attentive to the role of inapparent infections, capable of: estimating the expected unfolding of the outbreak under continuous lockdown (baseline trajectory); assessing deviations from the baseline, should lockdown relaxations result in increased disease transmission; calculating the isolation effort required to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak. A 40% increase in effective transmission would yield a rebound of infections. A control effort capable of isolating daily  ~5.5% of the exposed and highly infectious individuals proves necessary to maintain the epidemic curve onto the decreasing baseline trajectory. We finally provide an ex-post assessment based on the epidemiological data that became available after the initial analysis and estimate the actual disease transmission that occurred after weakening the lockdown.\n\nIntroduction\nAlthough the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is still ravaging most countries of the world1,2 and containment measures are implemented worldwide3, a debate is emerging on whether these measures might be partially alleviated, and in case how and when4,5,6,7,8,9. This discussion requires appropriate models that guide decision-makers through alternative actions via scenarios of the related trajectories of the epidemic.\n\nThe setup of country-wide epidemiological models10,11 is particularly challenging for SARS-CoV-2 owing to inapparent infections12,13,14, and to the marked spatial heterogeneity of the epidemic spread11. For example, in Italy, where the (largely underestimated) reported infections and deaths were, respectively, 207,428 and 28,236 as of May 1, the latitudinal characters of the spread of infections showed marked delays in the beginning of the local outbreaks11.\n\nTo make things even more complicated, empirical evidence suggests that mildly symptoma infectious individuals could be as contagious as symptomatic ones12,15. Pre-symptomatic infectious cases are also an important vehicle of infection, as epitomized by the value of the pre-symptomatic transmission parameter, which proves larger than the transmission rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections11. This is supported by field epidemiological evidence16,17,18 and virological findings reporting cases of COVID-19 fueled by strong pre- or oligo-symptomatic transmission19,20,21 and shedding22.\n\nWe base our analysis on a recently published, spatially explicit model of the COVID-19 spread in Italy, inclusive of mobility among communities, the timing of infection seeding, mobility restrictions and social distancing11. We assume that, for the time being and in the near-term, no imported infections occur from outside the national boundaries. The model is a spatial system of coupled ordinary differential equations that solves in time, and for each of the 107 Italian provinces, the balance of, and the coupled fluxes among, several epidemiological compartments in which the total population of a community is subdivided. Specifically, we describe the dynamics of individuals who are susceptible, latently infected, at peak infectivity, asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic, infected with heavy symptoms, and recovered (see “Methods” section). Local communities are connected by mobility fluxes of individuals from the mobile epidemiological compartments (susceptible, exposed, peak infectivity, asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic, and recovered individuals). Thus, the force of infection of each community (see “Methods” section) depends not only on the local epidemiological variables, but also on those of the connected communities. Infections, therefore, not only do occur within each community, but can also be imported from, or exported to, linked communities. In addition, the model accounts for infections occurring because individuals of different communities meet in a third location. The relative balance of the fluxes among the various compartments is regulated by process parameters that are estimated in a Bayesian framework (see “Methods” section).\n\nThe fundamental improvements of our framework with respect to other non-spatial, well-mixed models initially devised for single megacities23, or for a whole country24, lie in the detailed description of the geographic context and its networks of epidemiological interactions. Therefore, we have updated the benchmark model11 through the estimation of parameters using the number of daily hospitalized cases in all 107 Italian provinces from February 24 to May 1 (see “Methods” section). To estimate parameters, we account for the set of progressively more restrictive measures that were introduced from February 22 (initial restrictive measures) to March 22, when Italy went into a full lockdown closing also non-essential industrial and other production activities25,26,27.\n\nAvailable epidemiological data28,29,30 must be viewed as an approximation. In fact, confirmed infections depend on testing efforts that local officials were able to deploy to identify confirmed infections, thus leading to under-reporting. The ratio of confirmed to actual infections was estimated to be around 10%11. Under-reporting applies even to fatality counts, although to a lesser extent with respect to reported infections31,32. Moreover, fatality rate can change in time due to stress in health care facilities32. In order to alleviate these problems, in this work we used for parameter estimation only reconstructed data on daily rates of hospitalization (see “Methods” section).\n\nHealth-policy and science underpin the design of suitable containment strategies, which include individual and collective (local and medium- to long-distance) mobility limitations25, provision of personal protective equipment (PPE)33, massive, possibly targeted identification of infectious cases34,35, and the setup of layers of administrative and environmental engineering controls33. These strategies must consider the level of connectivity realized among communities after lockdown release, and the different epidemiological parameters that effectively characterize them10,11. Recent results on the effects of lifting restrictions in the Boston area suggest that a response system based on enhanced contact tracing and testing can have a major role in relaxing social distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-236.\n\nHere, we generate scenarios of the Italian infection dynamics resulting from the bulk effect of lifting the current restrictions, which initiated on May 4. How will the modes of relaxation of previous confinement measures affect residual epidemic trajectories? The answer to this question is not trivial, because different activities will be allowed to resume at different times. In addition, acquired awareness may have different lasting effects on social behavior regardless of imposed measures, and compliance to proper use of PPE33 may fade away in time. Here, we propose to assess the actual change in overall transmission by tracking the departure of the epidemic curve from the one projected by using the transmission rate achieved during the lockdown. We then address the mitigation of the likely increased exposure, in particular by estimating the sufficient number of case isolation interventions that would prevent rebounding of the epidemics. Finally, we provide an ex-post assessment of the explored scenarios comparing them with the actual space-time progression of the outbreak as measured by the epidemiological data that became available after the initial submission of this study.\n\nResults\nParameter estimation and model results\nThe model reproduces well the prevalence of cumulative hospitalizations in the 107 Italian provinces up to May 1 (Figs. 1 and 2). By considering heterogeneous transmission rates after March 22 (see “Methods” section), we estimate a large reduction in the effective disease transmission rate in each province. This reduction, expressed as a ratio of effective transmission estimated on May 1 to the initial uncontrolled one, ranges between 0.3 and 0.4 depending on location (Fig. 1d). Technically, this reduction is computed via the product of the reduction in transmission rates (βP3/βP0, see “Methods” section) times the fraction of the population still susceptible to the infection on May 1. The latter, however, is very sensitive to the fraction of infections that develop heavy symptoms (parameter σ in the model, see “Methods” section). The reference value assumed is σ = 25%, which is consistent with empirical evidence10. However, we carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the role of inapparent infections12 by repeating parameter estimation with σ = 10% and 50% as well, thus covering a broad enough spectrum of possible values. All other parameters, whose meaning is detailed in the “Methods” section, are reported in Table 1.\n\nFig. 1: Geography of COVID-19 spread in Italy.\nfigure1\nThe comparative analysis of data and model results for hospitalizations in 107 Italian provinces as of May 1, 2020 is supported by: a a sketch of the Italian regions; b, c the prevalence of cumulative hospitalizations in each Italian province up to May 1, reconstructed data (b) and model simulations (c); d ratio between the estimated transmission rate on May 1, and the one estimated at the beginning of the outbreak (February 24).\n\nFull size image\nTable 1 Model parameters.\nFull size table\nScenarios of national and regional epidemic trajectories\nIf the transmission rates estimated at the end of the lockdown persisted indefinitely, the epidemic curve would continue to decrease in all Italian regions (baseline scenario, blue curve in Fig. 2), although at different rates. We report for convenience daily hospitalization counts aggregated for administrative regions, although the model accounts for a finer spatial granularity (107 provinces and metropolitan areas, see Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 2: Daily numbers of newly hospitalized cases for Italy and its hardest hit regions.\nfigure2\nShown here are reconstructed data (empty circles), and model results (solid lines and confidence intervals). Clockwise from top: Italy, Lombardia, Piemonte, Marche, Veneto, and Emilia Romagna. The remaining regions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The blue solid line represents the baseline scenario, i.e., the median of the computed results with transmission estimated during lockdown maintained indefinitely beyond May 3, 2020. The green and purple solid lines represent the scenarios corresponding to a release of the containment measures determining an effective increase in the overall transmission rates of, respectively, 20% and 40%. The 95% confidence intervals are color-coded in analogy to their median scenarios. Plots refer to a fraction of infections leading to heavy symptoms σ equal to 25%. Plots referring to the other two values considered (σ = 50% and 10%) are reported in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3.\n\nFull size image\nThe lockdown in Italy has been relaxed on May 4. Here, we propose to assess the actual increase in overall transmission of the infection by tracking the departure of the residual epidemic curve from the baseline scenario. This allows us to estimate the overall effect of the new exposure caused by the local lockdown relaxations. An increase of 20% in the transmission rate, subsumimg the effective combination of economic activities’ resumption and modified contact rates, yields a decline milder than that of the baseline for the new daily hospitalization cases in most Italian regions. A 40% increase would instead determine a significant rebound of the epidemic in most regions (Fig. 2, see also Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nThe trajectories shown in Fig. 2 prove robust with respect to the assumed value of σ, at least for the relatively short projection horizons considered here, which are relevant to contingency planning. Indeed, the curves in Fig. 2, obtained with σ = 25%, compare well with those reported in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3, obtained by assuming σ = 50% and 10%, respectively.\n\nThe fraction of susceptible individuals obtained for different values of σ, the heavy symptomatic fraction, strongly varies throughout the Italian regions (Fig. 3). Since the beginning of the epidemic up to May 1, the susceptible fraction of the population has decreased more markedly in the northern regions, which have been more severely hit by the outbreak, with the minimum values reached in Lombardia (0.97, 0.95, and 0.87 with σ = 50%, 25%, and 10%, respectively). By contrast, central and southern regions had minimal reductions of their susceptible fraction. These results bear obvious implications on possible revamping of the epidemics reaching new peaks of dangerous proportions, as it denies any short- or medium-term possibilities to attain herd immunity.\n\nFig. 3: Mapping possible acquired immunity in Italy.\nfigure3\nTemporal dynamics of the fraction of susceptible individuals in each region, estimated by considering three possible percentages of heavy symptomatic infections: σ =  50% (blue curve), 25% (green curve), and 10% (red curve). Thick solid curves refer to medians values, whereas shaded areas indicate the 95% confidence intervals.\n\nFull size image\nDifferent assumptions for σ result in different values of the infection fatality rate (IFR), defined as the ratio between the official death count (at a certain date) and the corresponding total number of infections estimated by the model. As of May 1, we estimate an IFR of 4%, 2%, and 0.8%, respectively for σ = 50%, 25%, and 10%.\n\nIsolation effort\nIsolation of cases to counterbalance the possible increase in transmission following the relaxation of the restrictive measures is a conceivable strategy, alternative to extending lockdown or to stop-and-go enforcement of containment measures6. The isolation effort critically depends on tracing and testing. Evidence of peak of viral shedding before and right after symptom onset15 (see also “Methods” section) suggests that isolation is more effective if targeted at incubating individuals, i.e., those in the exposed, E, and peak of infectivity, P, compartments of the model (according to the parameters reported in Table 1, around 86% of the infections occur through contact with an individual at peak infectivity). We therefore focus on the E and P compartments and estimate the percentage and the corresponding number of individuals that should be isolated daily (Fig. 4, see “Methods” section) to counterbalance a possible increase in transmission resulting from the loosening of the containment measures, thus maintaining the epidemic curve in the decreasing trajectory achieved during the lockdown (blue lines in Fig. 2). In analogy to the analyses presented above, we show results under the three different assumptions about the heavy symptomatic fraction: σ = 50%, 25%, and 10%.\n\nFig. 4: Charting the isolation efforts required to control COVID-19 in Italy.\nfigure4\nDaily number (left axis) and daily percentage (right axis) of exposed E and individuals at peak infectivity, P, to be isolated daily to maintain the epidemic trajectory onto the blue curve in Fig. 2 (corresponding to the baseline scenario) despite the possible increase in transmission induced by the actual release of restrictions (horizontal axes). Different columns refer to different values of the symptomatic fraction σ: 50% (left, blue), 25% (center, green), and 10% (right, red). Solid lines refer to median values, shaded areas to the 95% (lighter shade), and 50% confidence intervals. In each panel, median and 95% confidence interval of E, P and new daily symptomatic cases (C) are given (estimates refer to May 4). The dashed black lines indicate the estimated number of E and P individuals that can be isolated by tracing all the infections generated by the new daily symptomatic cases. The other Italian regions are shown in Supplementary Figs. 4, 5, and 6.\n\nFull size image\n Figure 4 also reports the estimated abundances of exposed, E, and individuals at peak infectivity, P, in the considered regions at the date of the announced new measures (May 4), along with the expected number of new daily symptomatic cases (C) predicted by the model. As an example, in Lombardia an increase in transmission of 40% would lead to a rebound of the epidemic curve (Fig. 2). However, for the reference value of σ = 25%, daily isolation of about  ~1200 out of  ~22,000 (~5.5%) individuals belonging to the E and P compartments would effectively counterbalance the increase in transmission and bring back the curve to the baseline scenario (blue curve in Fig. 2). The reported isolation target in terms of the number of individuals to be isolated (left axis of Fig. 4) refers to the necessary effort right after the relaxation of the containment measures. If the epidemic is successfully controlled, and the cases continue to decline (i.e., they follow the baseline scenario), the isolation effort proportionally decreases over time. The isolation effort in terms of percentage of E and P individuals to be isolated (right axis of Fig. 4) remains instead constant.\n\nAlthough the isolation effort expressed as percentage of the E and P individuals to be isolated daily is not particularly sensitive to the assumed fraction of infections developing heavy symptoms, σ, the value changes markedly when expressed in terms of the absolute number of individuals (Fig. 4). As σ decreases, a larger fraction of the epidemic remains unobserved. Therefore, to closely match the daily hospitalizations data, a much larger pool of E and P individuals is estimated (Fig. 4).\n\nTo assess the feasibility of the isolation effort required to contain the epidemic, we report the amount that can be achieved by tracing and isolating all the infections generated by the new daily symptomatic cases (black dashed lines in Fig. 4). For a given increase in transmission, a required effort (solid lines in Fig. 4) exceeding such amount implies that tracing and isolation of all primary infections generated by the new daily symptomatic cases is insufficient. In this case, secondary infections (i.e., infections generated by the primary infectees) need also to be targeted. As the role of the unobserved epidemic increases (i.e., σ decreases, from left to right columns in Fig. 4), isolation of primary contacts alone can compensate only for mild increases in transmission.\n\nThe timing of the relaxation of the restrictive measures also has a great impact on the isolation effort required to control the epidemic. Delaying the release of containment measures by an additional month would have reduced the abundance of E and P individuals by about two-thirds, thus proportionally reducing the number of individuals that need be isolated (Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\nEx-post assessment\nThe analysis presented above was based on data up to May 1, 2020 (see also ref. 37). Data that became available afterward allows for ex-post assessments of the trajectories projected in Fig. 2. Among the three scenarios explored, the actual progression of the outbreak in the Italian territory after the lifting of lockdown measures is consistent with the baseline scenario (Fig. 5). Some regions, notably Piemonte, exhibit a case count significantly lower than the one predicted by the baseline scenario. To properly quantify such variations in the outbreak dynamics, we re-estimated model parameters including the newly data available (up to June 17, 2020) and an additional parameter controlling the transmission after lockdown was relaxed (see “Methods” section). As the newly available data starts before the end of the lockdown (May 1 vs May 4) and there is an intrinsic delay before variations in transmission appear in hospitalization data, the new parameter estimation exercise enables also an updated evaluation of transmission occurring in the last phase of the lockdown (parameter βP3, see “Methods” section).\n\nFig. 5: Ex-post assessment.\nfigure5\nDaily numbers of newly hospitalized cases for Italy and its hardest hit regions. Clockwise from top: Italy, Lombardia, Piemonte, Marche, Veneto, and Emilia Romagna. The remaining regions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. Red empty circles represent data available for the projection of the scenarios presented in Fig. 2, gray empty circles show the newly available data. Blue colors (solid line: median results, shaded area: 95% confidence intervals) report here, for the sake of comparison, the baseline scenario already presented in Fig. 2. Black colors show the results of the updated parameter estimation that exploits all data available up to June 17.\n\nFull size image\nThe results of our analysis (Fig. 5 and Table 2) show that most regions experienced a decrease of the median transmission rate between the last phase of the lockdown and the following period. Notably, Lombardia, the most severely hit region that accounts for 39% of total Italian cases to date and 54% of those occurred after lockdown relaxation, and Molise are estimated to have experienced an increase in the median transmission (but note that the estimate for Molise, one of the smallest Italian region by number of residents and among the least hit by COVID-19, is marked by large uncertainty). At the country scale, the aggregate count of new daily hospitalized cases is slightly lower than the baseline scenario (Fig. 5).\n\nTable 2 Ex-post assessment of transmission rate.\nFull size table\nDiscussion\nThe results obtained with the data up to the end of lockdown, whose reliability to issue scenarios stems from their capability to closely match the hospitalization data locally and globally, probed in particular the role of inapparent infections by assuming a rather broad range of values of σ. The highest value (σ = 50%) matches the empirical results found by testing for two weeks an entire community (Vo’ Euganeo, IT, ~3000 inhabitants)12, whereas the lowest (σ = 10%) is likely to be a lower bound, unachievable in the actual geographic context, because it may reflect also the age structure of a much younger population38. Another way to assess the plausibility of the assumed fraction of infections that develop heavy symptoms, is to compare the IFR estimated with different values of σ. The values of IFR corresponding to σ = 25% and σ = 10% (2% and 0.8%, respectively) bracket the available estimates of IFR for western countries39. Thus the median value assumed (σ = 25%) seems like a sensible choice to probe the actual role of the unobserved epidemics in Italy.\n\nSocial distancing, PPE use, reduced or impeded mobility, and increased awareness led to an overall decrease of transmission of about 65% with respect to the initial uncontrolled epidemic (Fig. 1d). This result is consistent with other estimates obtained using different methods40,41, and is largely attributable to the implemented measures, and only marginally to acquired immunity. Indeed, even in the most extreme scenario considered here (σ = 10%), the acquired immunity would be responsible for less than 15% of the reduction occurred in the most severely hit region (Lombardia, Fig. 3), suggesting that herd immunity is far away even in the hardest hit territories. Seasonality effects5, not explicitly accounted for here, might also have had a role in the reduction of transmission.\n\nThe scenarios shown in Fig. 2 suggest the impact of social distancing, testing, contact tracing and household quarantine on a possible second-wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy (see also ref. 36). The heterogeneous estimates of transmission achieved in the last phase of the lockdown (Fig. 1d) translate in a differential regional response to a possible increase in transmission. Noticeable, the heavily hit region of Lombardia would withstand an increase of +20% of transmission without a rebound of the number of new daily cases (Fig. 2) because our estimates indicate that virus transmission was substantially reduced during the lockdown. By comparison Piemonte, a region that shares with Lombardia a similar susceptibility profile (Fig. 3), might witness a rebound in the same scenario because virus transmission is estimated to still be sustained at the end of the lockdown (Fig. 1d). Such differential spatial effects highlight the relevance of properly accounting for the geography of the disease and to design tailored parameter estimation frameworks capable of capturing heterogeneity in transmission.\n\nAn observed deviation of incoming epidemiological data from the baseline scenario in Fig. 2 (say, towards an unacceptable epidemic trajectory like the purple curve) should raise a red flag and call for control action. Matching the right scenario in real time may be achieved through data assimilation and ensemble Kalman filtering10. The continuous update of the estimated state and parameters of the system, in fact, would allow the coupling of feedback and feed-forward controls, thus projecting the number of apparent and inapparent infections at least a latency period ahead of time. Incidentally, we deem this feature a significant advance produced by our method. Indeed, this procedure would provide—in time for action—a reasoned assessment of the actual exposure, in particular the number of exposed and infectious individuals that only models can evaluate. This is tantamount to distinguishing, after lifting the lockdown, between potential and realized transmission. The former is the maximum possible prevention of contagion given a set of rules. The latter is the bulk effect of the effective compliance to precautions associated with the relaxation of the lockdown. Thus, an increase in estimated exposure reflects the actual collective behaviors of mobile individuals, and the collective respect of rules regarding social distancing, PPE adoption, or crowding, to name a few. We argue that realized transmission can only be evaluated from early signs decoded from scenarios implemented through a model akin to ours.\n\nControl may consist in either re-tightening of the containment measures, possibly of the stop-and-go type5,8, or alternative interventions. Although the strategy adopted during the first phase of the outbreak mostly relied on the isolation and treatment of symptomatic cases, a different mix of interventions is possible and desirable for the second phase. A keystone of such a mix should be an increased isolation effort by tracing42 and testing6,34 individuals who have been in close contact with a known infection26,43, possibly with the help of technological advances like tracing apps35.\n\nWe estimated the isolation target needed to counterbalance an increase in effective transmission (Fig. 4), and to maintain the epidemic trajectory onto the decreasing pattern achieved during lockdown. One way to achieve the required isolation target is to trace the close contacts of daily new symptomatic cases, who are more likely to self-report or be otherwise identified. It should be noted, however, that infected individuals might not immediately test positive (e.g., individuals that are categorized in the exposed compartment E are unlikely to be detected, see, e.g., ref. 44). Moreover, obtaining test results takes time, therefore this strategy might imply, as a matter of precaution, to isolate, at least temporarily, all close contacts that the symptomatic case has had in the previous days. Tracing and isolating all primary infections generated by the symptomatic cases is a challenging task, because tracing is hardly exhaustive and not all symptomatic cases can be identified. Depending on the extent of the unobserved epidemic, however, isolation of primary infections might not suffice (Fig. 4). Secondary contacts ought to be targeted as well in this case. Testing primary contacts would help identifying actually infected cases, thus refining the tracing of secondary contacts34. We also showed that, if the isolation target proves impossible to achieve for the limits of resources and/or logistical reasons, a possible strategy may consist in delaying further relaxations of confinement measures. Our results thus suggest that each Italian region should carefully evaluate its current strategies for tracing, testing and its isolation capacity, to plan and manage the second phase of the epidemic.\n\nThe ex-post assessment of the projected scenarios, provided in Fig. 5 and Table 2, shows that the likely increase in contact rate among individuals following the partial relaxation of the restrictive measures that began on May 4 did not lead to a significant increase in transmission rate as of June 17. A notable exception is Lombardia, the most populated Italian region and the one struck the hardest by the epidemic, which is instead estimated to have experienced an increase in the virus transmission. Several intertwined factors could explain these patterns of disease progression after lifting the lockdown. In the following we discuss what we deem most relevant. Restrictive measures have been only partially released: education, from pre-school to higher education, will resume in-presence activities only in September; large gatherings are still forbidden; every commercial activity and workplace is still subject to stringent protocols to ensure social distancing and avoid infections; PPE are mandatory in every indoor setting but one’s own household and recommended outdoors whenever preventing social contact is not possible. Altogether, these measures may have contributed significantly to avoid a recrudescence of virus transmission. In particular, evidence accumulates for the crucial role of face masks in reducing transmission45,46.\n\nAlthough there is no public data set about contact tracing and isolation, anecdotal evidence and news reports suggest that the effort in such direction has improved in many regional health departments. In our updated estimation (Fig. 5), we did not explicitly account for this effort; however, as detailed in the analysis presented in Fig. 4, increased isolation effort is expected to have the same macroscopic effect as reduced transmission. The abatement of the number of cases achieved during the lockdown period has arguably facilitated the logistics of contact tracing and isolation. It is interesting to note, in fact, that Lombardia—still counting dozens of new daily cases, which in turn makes contact tracing challenging—is the only region showing a significant increase in transmission.\n\nSome authors have suggested that COVID-19 transmission may be subject to seasonal variations in analogy with other human coronaviruses (see, e.g., ref. 5). However, this hypothesis is still debated among experts, and a clear evidence has not emerged yet. Should warmer, drier weather be proven to actually hinder transmission, such factor could have played a role in Italy during the timeframe analyzed herein.\n\nDuring lockdown, transmission was reportedly sustained also by epidemic foci in long-term care facilities and hospitals. Succeeding in controlling these mostly local infection chains would have reduced the overall transmission regardless of the restrictive measures. However, also in this case there is not enough granularity in the data to properly support this hypothesis.\n\nFinally, on a more technical side, when virus transmission is slow and occurs in several independent foci, it is possible that infection chains self-extinguish because of demographic stochasticity. Our modeling framework assumes continuous state variables and therefore it does not account for the stochasticity induced by discrete events. As such, our model can overestimate infections when the case count is low.\n\nTo keep the epidemic under control, health policy makers should continue to consider a portfolio of interventions that include the re-tightening of confinement measures, possibly with a stop-and-go implementation based also on seasonality effects, or evidence on limits to the acquired immunity47, and/or the effective isolation of infectious individuals4,10. Modeling studies can provide reasoned estimates of the minimum target to be attained. The proper strategy to achieve the isolation target is the domain of public health policy. The complementary use of testing in the control strategy is instead the domain of virology and epidemiology. To both domains, proper modeling scenarios offer information otherwise unavailable.\n\nMethods\nEpidemiological model\nHere, we use the model SEPIA11.

The Coronavirus\ndisease (Covid-19) is a new strain that was discovered in\nChina in 2019 and has not been previously identified in\nhumans and earth. As of 7 April 2020, the Covid-19 had\ninfected more than 1.2 million people, killed more than\n72 thousand and spread all over the world [1]. The latest\nsituation has updated by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) day by day.\nOn 11 March 2020, the WHO officially declared the\nCovid-19 outbreak as a pandemic due to the global spread\nand severity of the disease. Before the Covid-19, there\nare four pandemics in the last two century: “Spanish Flu”\n[caused by an Influenza A(H1N1) virus] in 1918, the\n“Asian Flu” [caused by an Influenza A(H2N2) virus] in\n1957, and the “Hong Kong Flu” [caused by an Influenza\nA(H3N2) virus] in 1968 plus swine flu in 2009. Pandemic\ncomes etymologically from a Greek word “pandemos”, it\nmeans a global epidemic, it is distinguished from an epidemic, which may connote limitation to a smaller area\nand a concept pertaining to all people and the public in\nthe world. Therefore, a pandemic is defined as the highest level of global health emergency and affecting multiple\nregions of the world. In general, declaring a pandemic is\nassumed a historical event since it is not just a health issue,\nit has also economic, political and social dimensions at the\nglobal level.\nIf social, political and economic life in the future will\nshow different trends after the Covid-19 as predicted,\nthe future of cities with populations of 30 million will\nbe questioned further. The values of collective living of\ntraditional societies that resist modernism will become\nmore controversial. While the speed of individualization\nwhich begins with modernism will increase, nation-states\nmight feel themselves under more threat. Groups that have\nthe same sentimental values as religious communities will\nlose their momentum and they will begin to transform\ninto an individual nature as well. In addition, multiBackground/aim: Individuals infected by the Covid-19 potentially are at risk of health and economic well-being. Today, the Covid-19\nis a global issue, and the world economy can be interpreted as almost at the standstill. In this context, this study aims to discuss the potential first reactions of short and long term global economic impacts of the pandemic through sectors by assessing its costs according\nto the data announced for both the world and Turkey. In addition, this study tries to put forth possible economic and political scenarios\nfor the post-pandemic world.\nMaterials and methods: This is a review article that summarizes the current reports and discussions about the economic consequences\nof this historical event, and tries to make some inferences considering them.\nResults: This pandemic has severe adverse effects on the employees, customers, supply chains and financial markets, in brief, most\nprobably it will cause a global economic recession. Nevertheless, due to the uncertainty of the end of this pandemic, both the length and\nscale of this contraction are not predictable.\nConclusion: It takes a while for the world economy to recover from the contraction. It seems that this pandemic will lead to a permanent\nshift in the world and its politics, especially in health, security, trade, employment, agriculture, manufacturing goods production and\nscience policies. Since this new world might provide great opportunities for some countries that did not dominate world production\nbefore, governments should develop new strategies to adjust the new world order without much delay.\nKeywords: Covid-19, economy, pandemic\nReceived: 01.04.2020 Accepted/Published Online: 11.04.2020 Final Version: 21.04.2020\nReview Article\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n521\nAÇIKGÖZ and GÜNAY / Turk J Med Sci\nstorey buildings and crowded cities will lose their speed\nof development, the existing clean water networks and the\napartment life where the community lives together will\nbecome questionable due to the threat of life safety. As\ncrowded cities will tend to lose their significance achieved\nafter the industrial revolution, cleanliness, health, and\nhygiene will have a priority in social life. Moreover,\nboth communities and countries might disrupt some\ndemocratic values and fundamental human rights; hence,\nauthoritarianism might become widespread by increased\nsecurity measures. The future of healthcare sector, the\npersonal and professional rights of its professionals, ethic\nvalues like physicians right to refuse medical treatment\nfor life-threatening illness or life-sustaining, and also\nthe establishment of hospitals for untreated illness will\nbe among the main issues to be discussed soon but\nmost probably these future planning will cost the world\neconomy.\nOld habits related to consuming unpackaged foods and\nsales market conditions will not be able to pursue as it is,\nand new protection mechanisms such as preservation and\npackaging for the nutritious food will bring new costs to\nthe consumers. With the very high concern for cleanliness\nand health, the future of paper money and coins circulated\nfor the transactions will also be discussed further, and\ngovernments will create new customs walls. Hence,\ncountries’ trade amount and speed will be under threat,\nand countries ensuring the hygiene standard comparing\nto others will gain a competitive advantage. On the other\nhand, global viruses will be seen as a threat like a nuclear\nattack or global terrorism since their impacts on the human\nand the world are similarly very destructive as seen in the\nCovid-19. For this reason, countries that could develop a\nbiological defence system or infrastructure for the virus\nattack will have more power in the world. However, if they\nwill use this power to achieve their national and imperial\ngoals, this will most likely create even more inequality\namong the countries.\nToday, the spreading of the Covid-19 virus is\nhaving gradual effects like major economic depression.\nEconomically, if countries hit by sudden and unexpected\ndisease, countries’ revenue will drop due to the fall\nin overall economic activities. The contraction of the\neconomy would begin with the diminishing of the travel\nand tourism sectors. Then, their widespread effects\ndamage aggregate production and consumption with the\nlayoffs and bankruptcies in all sectors. The unemployment\nrate rises, and to survive the economy, governments and\nthe central banks must step in by increasing government\nspending and decreasing interest rates, respectively to\n1\n World Bank (2018).

Nevertheless,\nestimating the economic costs from a global disease is\nnow ambiguous since the pandemic has spiral effects\nboth on the national and global economy that means\nany economic shock to one country is quickly spread to\nother countries through the increased trade and financial\nlinkages associated with globalization [2]. According\nto the World Bank (WB) report published in 2013, “…\na severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its\nsudden, profound, and widespread impact,” and a severe\npandemic could cause economic losses equal to nearly 5%\nof global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or more than $3\ntrillion [3]. The United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) announced that the Covid-19\nwill likely cost the global economy at least $2 trillion in\n2020 [4].\nIn accordance with the predictions presented above,\nespecially because of their economic contents, it is necessary\nto investigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the\nglobal and Turkish economy. Some studies in the literature\nare examining the global or regional economic costs of\ndiseases such as SARS [2,5–8]. In addition, the World\nBank and the Rockefeller Foundation published a report\nabout pandemic risk even long before the pandemic [3,9].\nRecently, the media and some foundations have reported\nseveral reports on the economic consequences of the\nCovid-19 pandemic but so far, there has been no study\nanalysing the potential consequences of a pandemic on\nthe world and the Turkish economy in the literature yet. In\nthis context, the primary purpose of this study is to fill this\ngap by presenting the likely macroeconomic effects of the\nlatest pandemic according to the data announced for both\nthe world and Turkey. Besides, this study aims to forecast\nthe possible short and long term effects of the pandemic\non the global economy and politics by taking into account\nthe current discussions.\n2. Global economic costs of pandemic\nChina, where the Covid-19 virus originated in, is the most\npopulous country with nearly 1.4 billion residents1\n and\nthe world’s second biggest economy, with a GDP of $13.6\ntrillion2\n. China has been fighting the Covid-19 pandemic\nsince December 2019 but this battle devastated China’s\neconomy in the first quarter of 2020. China is the crucial\ncountry as a source of both demand and supply, and a focus\nof concern for financial markets for the rest of the world;\nhereby, adverse developments in China have spillover\neffects on the other countries [10]. The Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\nannounced that growth prospect for China has been \n522\nAÇIKGÖZ and GÜNAY / Turk J Med Sci\nrevised down sharply to below 5% this year after 6.1% in\n2019. Accordingly, global economic growth is projected\nto fall to 2.4% in 2020, compared to 2.9% in 2019, but it\ncould fall as low as 1.5% due to the drop in overall global\neconomic activities [10].\nTourism is a huge global business that accounts for 10.4%\nof global GDP and 10% of global employment according to\nthe World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) [11]. Only\nChinese tourists account for around one-tenth of all crossborder visitors and a huge drop in outbound tourism from\nChina leads to an adverse demand shock in many countries\n[10]. With the spreading of the virus all around the world,\nthe World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) announced\nthat the tourism sector is currently one of the hardest-hit\nby the Covid-19, with impacts on both travel supply and\ndemand. An expected fall in international tourist arrivals\nwill be between 20% and 30% could translate into a decline\nin international tourism receipts of between $300 and 450\nbillion [12]. The International Air Transport Association\n(IATA) estimated cost airlines as much as $252 billion with\na 44% drop in lost revenue due to the collapse of the airline\nindustry [13].\nOn the other hand, China ranked first in goods\nand services exports with an export value of about $2.7\ntrillion and second in imports with $2.6 trillion in 20183\n.\nAccordingly, China’s production relations with other\ncountries cover a broad space that cannot be filled quickly.\nChina has a key role in global supply chains as a producer of\nintermediate goods, particularly in computers, electronics,\npharmaceuticals, and transport equipment, and as the\nprimary source of demand for many commodities.\nGeneral Administration of Customs stated that China’s\noverall exports and imports contracted by 17.2% and 4%,\nrespectively in the first two mounts of 2020 [14]. Over\nthat time, China’s industrial production fell by 13.5% and\nindustrial profits decreased by 38.3% [15,16]. Around\nthe world, businesses are dealing with lost revenue and\ndisrupted supply chains due to factory closures in China.\nHowever, the extended factory closures in China will not\nonly affect the supply of those products but also hurt other\nmarkets’ ability to produce goods.\nFurthermore, the uncertainty in China is harmful\nto global oil prices since China is the world’s biggest\noil importer with 20.2% of total crude oil imports4\n.\n3\n World Bank (2018).

Website https://\nNevertheless, global oil demand has been hit hard by the\nCovid-19 because of the widespread contraction of China’s\neconomy and the drop in demand fuels and gasoline with\nthe travel bans. Meanwhile, the price war between major\noil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia continues, and they\nhave continuously increased production to overwhelm\nglobal oil markets with supply. The price of something\nis determined by the interplay of supply and demand\nbut two of the world’s biggest oil producers cause a huge\nunbalance between demand and supply in the oil market.\nAs a result of this, oil prices lost as much as a third of their\nvalue since the 1991 Gulf War5\n. In theory, falling oil prices\nshould be good for growth since business costs fall when\nfuel becomes cheaper and consumers’ purchasing power\nincrease for oil-based energy products. However, there is\nunlikely to be much of fuel demand in the short term due\nto the wide-ranging travel bans and curfews.\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO)\nannounced that between 5.3 million and 24.7 million\njobs will be lost because of the economic crisis caused by\nthe Covid-19, and this deterioration in employment also\nmeans a large loss of income between $860 billion to $3.4\ntrillion by the end of 2020 for workers [17]. For example,\nin March 2020, the unemployment rate increased by 0.9%\npoint to 4.4% in the United States (US) [18] and more than\n6.6 million Americans have filed unemployment claims\nsince the pandemic began in the United States (US) [19].\nGlobal stock markets have fallen sharply as investors\ncontinue to worry about the broader uncertain economic\neffects of the pandemic. The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage and the Nikkei have all seen huge falls (more than\n25%) since the pandemic began6\n. Net portfolio flows and\nthe value of currencies of emerging economies against\nthe dollar have dropped significantly since the beginning\nof 2020 [20].To calm markets and encourage spending,\ncentral banks in many countries have cut interest rates\nto make borrowing cheaper and injected liquidity in the\nfinancial market to guarantee liquidity in sovereign and\nprivate credit markets. For example, the US Federal Reserve\nand the Bank of England cut their key interest rate to near\nzero7\n.In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB) took\naction, spending a €750 billion buying government debt\nand private securities before the end of 2020 [21]. \n523\nAÇIKGÖZ and GÜNAY / Turk J Med Sci\nRecently, governments have started to provide a\nsizable economic support package for their citizens\nand businesses, including mainly wage subsidies, cash\ntransfers to low-income households, as well as tax cuts and\nrent reductions for businesses. Also, both the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the WB announced $50 billion\nand $14 billion packages, respectively for financing to\nhelp countries suffering from the pandemic [22,23]. In\naddition, the US Senate passes a historic $2.2 trillion\nrescue package and the United Kingdom (UK) pays up to\n80% of employee wages for those unable to work due to\nthe pandemic to prevent bankruptcies, massive layoffs and\nnegative impact on aggregate demand8\n.\nEconomists predict that the pandemic is putting\ndownward pressure on inflation due to the volatility in\nsupply and demand shocks working in opposite and\nasynchronous ways [24]. While China’s Consumer Price\nIndex (CPI) rose by 5.2% due to mainly food inflation, the\nProducer Price Index (PPI) dropped 0.3 % in February\ndue to mainly decline in the price of raw materials [25,26].\nAlso, consumers intended to increase their spending on\ngroceries and non-food products for children in the US in\nMarch 2020 and they expected to decrease their spending\nfor almost every other product category9\n. Therefore,\ninflation in other countries will likely follow a similar trend\nlike China and the impact on consumer prices will continue\nuntil the production starts again. UNCTAD estimated the\noverall price decline would be 37% in 2020 [20].\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) monitoring, over\n160 countries have implemented nationwide closures,\ninvolving over 91% of the world’s student population10.\nIt carries high economic costs since working parents\nare more likely to miss work that leads to a wage loss\nand adverse impact on production in the short term. In\nthe long term, this situation will bring a deterioration in\nhuman capital that has a great impact on the economic\ndevelopment of countries.\n3. Costs of pandemic on the Turkish economy\nTurkey had managed to keep the Covid-19 virus away from\nthe country until 11 March 2020 when the first confirmed\ncase was declared. Before that, the OECD increased its\nexpectation for Turkish economy growth to 2.7% from\n0.9% and predicted that this pandemic would have a\npositive impact on the Turkish economy if the government\nwww.theguardian.com [accessed 23 March 2020].\n8\n World Economic Forum (2020).

Accordingly,\nTurkey expected the tourism boom and global demand\nshift in some sectors such as textiles, furniture, iron and\nsteel, and food. However, these predictions will not come\ntrue at least in the short term since pandemic has spread\nthroughout the country and all around the world, and now\nTurkey estimates the potential economic costs of this crisis.\nTurkey is the 19th largest economy in the world, with\na GDP of $771 billion2\n. Turkey’s overall export and import\nvalues were nearly $171 billion and $202 billion, respectively\nresulting in a negative trade balance of $31 billion in 2019.\nThe top export destinations of Turkey are Germany (9%),\nUK (6.3%), Italy (5.4%), Iraq (5.2%) and the US (4.7%) and\nthe top import origins are Russia (11.1%), China (9.1%),\nGermany (8.9%), the US (5.5%) and Italy (4.2%) [27], these\ndata show that the supply chain of Turkey does not depend\non China largely but other countries’ economies have also\nhit by the pandemic; hence, this would hurt the Turkish\nmanufacturing sector in the end. In March 2020; exports\ndecreased by 17.81% and imports increased by 3.13%\ncompared with March 2019 due to the pandemic [28].\nTurkish current account deficit recorded $1.804 million\nindicating an increase of $1.528 million compared to\nJanuary of the previous year, bringing the 12-month rolling\nsurplus to $6.494 million [29].However, the decline will be\nexpected in 2020 due to a lower goods trade surplus, which\nresults from the global economic disruptions caused by the\npandemic.\nTurkey has struggled with the high unemployment rate\n(13.7%) since 2018 [30]. It seems that the unemployment\nrate will increase especially among the blue-collar workers\nand service sector employees due to the bankruptcies, and\nclosures of factories and workplaces, who will probably\nsuffer the first economic losses of this pandemic. This will\nlead to a drop in the GDP growth of Turkey and income\nlosses for workers. Besides, the CPI of Turkey increased by\n11.86% annually and 0.57% monthly in March 2020. Health\nwith 2.78%, food and nonalcoholic beverages with 1.95%\nand miscellaneous goods and services with 1.24% were the\nmain groups where high monthly increases realized [31].\nTherefore, the rise will be expected at Turkish consumer\nprices through food inflation in the short term like all\naround the world. In addition, Turkey had around 50\nmillion visitors and $34.5 billion of tourism income in\n2019 [32], but the tourism sector will be hardly damaged if\nthe pandemic will not end by this summer.\n524\nAÇIKGÖZ and GÜNAY / Turk J Med Sci\nAdditionally, uncertainty will bring more risks for\ninvestors. Turkey’s Economic Confidence Index fell from\n97.5 to 91.8 [33] and the Real Sector Confidence Index\ndecreased from 106.9 to 99.7 [34] in March 2020 compared\nto the previous month due to the pandemic. The Central\nBank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) reduced the\ninflation rate from 10.75% to 9.75% to improve the financial\nconditions [35]. Today, Turkey’s 5 Years Credit Default\nSwap (CDS) premium value is high with 652.3 points on\n7 April 2020 compared to 230 points at the beginning of\n202011, and it can be interpreted that Turkish economy is\nunder the pressure of financial risk. Therefore, this higher\nCDS premium might cause pressure on the Turkish foreign\nborrowing interest rate to rise.\nThe Turkish government announced a $15.4 billion\neconomic stimulus package on 18 March 202012,\nintroducing a mix of tax cuts, payment deferrals and\nincreased pension payouts to help citizens and businesses.\nHowever, it seems that the government must pursue a\nmore long term economic measures to save jobs, reassure\nbusinesses and lessen the burden on those who have left\nwork. Turkey is also hosting the largest refugee population\nin the world, mostly Syrians displaced by the neighboring\ncivil war13 and this will bring a financial burden to the\ngovernment to protect these people. Nevertheless, if the oil\nprices would low in the long term, Turkey’s petroleum bill\nwill decrease, and this might be life-saving for the Turkish\neconomy as an energy importer country.\n4. Discussion\nThe OECD warned that the shock from the virus is already\nbigger than the 2008 global financial crisis.The OECD\nSecretary General Angel Gurría said: “many countries\nwould fall into recession and countries would be dealing\nwith the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic for\nyears to come”14. In addition, the IMF Managing Director\nKristalina Georgieva stated that “the outlook for global\ngrowth: for 2020 it is negative–a recession at least as bad\nas during the global financial crisis or worse. However, we\nexpect a recovery in 2021. To get there, it is paramount\nto prioritize containment and strengthen health systems–\neverywhere” [36]. According to these statements, we can\nsay that quicker recovery will depend on the uncertain\ntime of the end of the pandemic in the world.\n11 World Government Bonds (2020).

Website https://foreignpolicy.\ncom[accessed 1 April 2020].\nAccording to the McKinsey & Company report\npublished in March 2020, the world economy will face two\npossible future scenarios: delayed recovery or prolonged\ncontraction. In the first scenario, unemployment will rise;\nbankruptcies will put pressure on the banking system;\nmore liquidity and low interest rate will have a limited\neffect on demand; self-reinforcing recession will extend,\nand recovery will begin in the fourth quarter of 2020. In\nthe second scenario, increasing layoffs and bankruptcies\nwill feed to a self-reinforcing recession; a comprehensive\nbanking crisis will damage the world financial system, and\nall fiscal and monetary responses will be insufficient to stop\nthe recession until the second quarter of 2021 [37].\nThe OECD, IMF and World Bank have already warned\nthe governments to take effective and well-resourced\npublic health measures and implement well-targeted\npolicies to support health care systems to overcome the\nCovid-19 crisis [10,22,23]. Moreover, they have forced\ngovernments to take supportive macroeconomic and\nfiscal measures to restore confidence and demand in the\neconomy, and protect the jobs and the incomes of workers\nand businesses. Member of G20 governments announced\nin March 2020 that they will focus mainly on safeguard\npeople’s jobs and incomes, restore confidence, preserve\nfinancial stability, and minimize disruptions to trade\nand global supply chains with global cooperation [38].\nNevertheless, all support mechanisms will bring an extra\nburden on public economics, and most probably, the public\ndebt will increase more with the decreasing tax revenues.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic led to not only the public\nhealth crisis but also combined with a global recession,\nit has the potential to change politics and power around\nthe world. This is the big historical event like the fall of\nthe Berlin Wall, Brexit and September 11 Attacks for the\nworld. According to the twelve leading global thinkers’\npredictions15, the pandemic will change the world forever.\nThey pointed out that this pandemic is a world-shattering\nevent whose far-ranging consequences we can only begin\nto imagine today. For example, it will strengthen the state,\nreinforce nationalism, change global economic directions\nbetween East and West, and a new stage in globalization\nwill be started by the changing supply chain production\nstrategies. Additionally, American power might be\ncriticized; some countries might fail, and countries might \n525\nAÇIKGÖZ and GÜNAY / Turk J Med Sci\nprefer stability to profitability.\nBefore the Covid-19, the report published by the\nRockefeller Foundation in 2010 [9] stated that governments\nwould impose strict rules and restrictions on the public\nduring and even after the pandemic to protect themselves.\nAt first, the notion of a more controlled world would gain\nwide acceptance and approval. Then, the economic models\nconducted by authoritarian leaders would increase but\nauthoritarianism greatly would restrict entrepreneurial\nactivity and innovation. Hence, the public would support\nmore restrictions and control mechanisms but this would\nlead to deteriorations of the fundamental citizens’ rights.\nMoreover, the health and freedom paradigm might be one\nof the top topics in addition to the security and freedom\nparadigm in public policy, and authoritarianism and cooperation will be discussed as two opposite approaches to\novercome the health crisis in the post-pandemic world.\nCurrently, the Covid-19 brings some new issues in\nlabour and production markets. For example, closing\nfactories and forcing workers to stay at home or huge\nlayoffs are not actions policymakers do much. As this crisis\nis ongoing, the unemployment rate will be higher and\nthe supply chain disrupted further. The main priority of\norganizations will be the safety to protect their employees\nand how to maintain business operations in the postpandemic world. In this context, actions would be taken\nsuch as the implementation of a physical mechanism to\nreduce transmissions like cleaning, staggering shift, and\ncontingency plans for workplace closures. On the other\nhand, organizations will try to find alternative supply chain\nactions to respond to the crisis such as transparency on\nthe multi-tier supply chain, optimizing production and\ndistribution capacity, estimating realistic final consumer\ndemand, estimating inventory along the value chain, and\nfinding available logistics capacity [37].\nAs a conclusion, it is expected that pandemic will\nprovide some economic and political opportunities to some\ncountries if they manage to end the virus earlier. According\nto the discussions presented in this study, we summarize\npossible economic threats and opportunities for the\npost-pandemic world in Table. It seems that the Turkish\neconomy will be destroyed in the short term like the many\nother countries but if Turkey can manage to control the\nvirus soon, this would bring sustainable growth with the\naccelerating rise in manufacturing exports, tourism revenue\nand foreign investment in the short term. In addition, the\nworld will not be the same in the postpandemic era due to\nthe changing sensitivities in the social life or production\nmechanisms or governance of countries, as stated above.\nHence, Turkey must develop new strategies to adjust the\npostpandemic new world order without much delay to gain\nadvantage or not to be left behind.",

People ≥70 were deemed ‘Clinically\nVulnerable’. Distancing measures were introduced to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, these may have\na negative impact on older people who are vulnerable to social isolation and may have challenges accessing services and\nprovisions.\nObjectives: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the lives of older people.\nStudy design and setting: Cross-sectional telephone survey.\nParticipants: Community-dwelling older people, 76–97 years.\nOutcomes: Health anxiety; General health (RAND Short-form 36 Survey); Physical activity; Depression (PHQ-8); Anxiety\n(GAD-2); Loneliness; Access to services; Challenges, concerns and positive experiences.\nData analysis: Counts (%), means (SDs). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from open questions.\nResults: n = 142. 52% did not worry about their health; 76% rated their health as ‘good’, ‘very good’ or ‘excellent’; <10%\nmet the criteria indicative of depression (PHQ-8), or anxiety (GAD-2); 42% were less active than before lockdown; and 27%\nwere lonely at least some of the time. Over half of participants identified positive aspects.\nConclusions: Most participants reported good health with low levels of health anxiety, anxiety and depression. Many were\nable to identify positive aspects to lockdown and may be better equipped to deal with lockdown than anticipated. Strategies\nmay be required to ameliorate the negative impact of loneliness for a minority of older people, and help some resume previous\nactivity levels and pursuits.\nKeywords: COVID-19, older people, ageing, survey\nKey Points\n• Social distancing measures during COVID-19 may negatively impact the lives of older people.\n• We investigated the impact of social distancing measures on the lives of older people living in Bradford.\n• Most participants reported good health with low levels of health anxiety, anxiety and depression.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/50/2/341/5970510 by guest on 15 April 2021\nL. Brown et al.\n• Many were able to identify positive aspects to lockdown and may be better equipped to deal with lockdown than\nanticipated.\n• Strategies may be required to ameliorate the negative impact of loneliness for a minority of older people.\nBackground\nOn 23 March 2020, the UK government imposed a ‘lockdown’ banning non-essential travel and contact with people\noutside the home in response to the coronavirus disease\n2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. People 70 years and over were\nclassed as an at-risk ‘Clinically Vulnerable’ group and advised\nto minimise contact with people outside of their household\nand to remain at home wherever possible.\nThese measures were introduced to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19. However, implementation of these measures may have a potentially negative impact\non older people already vulnerable to loneliness and social\nisolation and who may have challenges accessing services and\nessential provisions. Furthermore, identification as an ‘at risk’\ngroup and frequent media portrayal as vulnerable can be\npatronising [1] and may impact on self-worth and heighten\nanxiety [2]. COVID-19 is proposed as a ‘Perfect Storm’\nfor older people’s mental health [2] with isolation measures\npotentially impacting on physical and mental function [3].\nSelf-isolation measures may disproportionately affect older\npeople whose social contact is often outside of the home\n[4,5].\nTo date, we have limited evidence on the impact of\nCOVID-19 measures on the lives of older people in\nthe UK.\nObjectives\nTo investigate the immediate impact of social distancing\nmeasures on the lives of older people (≥75 years) living in\nBradford during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethodology\nParticipants were identified from the Community Ageing\nResearch 75+ (CARE75+) longitudinal cohort study\n(ISRCTN16588124) [6]. Telephone survey was administered between 14 May 2020 and 1 June 20.\nInclusion criteria\nCARE75+ participants resident in Bradford (BD Postcode\narea) undergoing routine study assessments and consenting\nto be approached about other studies.\nExclusion criteria\nCare home residents, dementia diagnosis, lacking capacity to\nconsent.\nInitial contact\nEligible participants were posted study information and\ninformed that a researcher would telephone to discuss participation.\nTelephone contact\nResearchers provided details of the study, study confidentiality and data storage, and requested verbal consent to\nproceed.\nSurvey questions\nTopics were identified by the Bradford Institute for Health\nResearch COVID-19 Scientific Advisory Group (C-SAG)\n[7], with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) consultation\n[8].\nIncluded topics:\n• Self-isolation/social distancing\n• Health anxiety (selected item from Health Anxiety Inventory) [9]\n• General health (selected item from RAND Short-Form 36\nSurvey) [10]\n• Physical activity\n• Depression (Personal Health Questionnaire Depression\nScale, PHQ-8) [11]\n• Anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 2 scale, GAD-2) [12]\n• Loneliness (selected question) [13]\n• Access to and experience of health, pharmacy, social/council, voluntary services\n• Open questions about challenges, concerns and any positive aspects to life during the pandemic.\nAll questions: https://www.bradfordresearch.nhs.uk/care\n75/care75-covid-19/.\nData analysis\nDescriptive statistics, including frequencies (%), means\n(standard deviations), or non-parametric equivalents.\nThematic analysis identified themes from three open\nquestions by coding the data, generating labels for important\naspects, constructing and reviewing themes using Braun and\nClark’s six step framework [14].\nData input and storage\nData were collected and managed using Research Electronic\nData Capture (REDCap) electronic data capture tools\nhosted at BTHFT [15,16].

Of those, 142 participants from urban and\nrural locations across Bradford completed the survey. See\nStudy Flow Diagram (Supplementary data Appendix 1).\nParticipant characteristics are reported in Table 1.\nSelf-isolation\nIn all, 62% of participants reported self-isolating (not leaving\nthe house even for shopping) at the time of the survey\n(reasons for self-isolating reported in Table 1).\nHealth anxiety, general health and physical activity\n(Supplementary data—Appendix 2)\n343\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/50/2/341/5970510 by guest on 15 April 2021\nL. Brown et al.\nMost participants (52.1%) did not worry about their\nhealth. Participants rated their health as good (35.2%), very\ngood (28.9%) or excellent (12.0%).\nMost participants (59.9%) were carrying out physical\nactivities every day. 68.9% undertook physical activity\noutdoors every day/most days. Many (42.3%) were less\nactive than before lockdown. Some (16.9%) reported\nexercising more.\nDepression\nA total of 11 participants (7.7%) met the criteria indicative\nof major depression (score 10–19), and two (1.4%) for severe\nmajor depression (score ≥ 20). Invalid score (n = 1).\nAnxiety\nA total of 10 (7.0%) participants met the criteria indicative\nof generalised anxiety disorder (≥3).\nLoneliness\nLess than 5% of participants were lonely most or all of the\ntime. See Appendix 2. (Supplementary data—Appendix 2).\nAccess to services\nParticipants were asked if they had needed to access health,\nsocial/council, pharmacy or voluntary services since the\nCOVID-19 lockdown, if they had been able to access the\nservice, and if they received the required support (Table 2).\nWorries, concerns and positive experiences\nParticipants reported their challenges, concerns and positive\nlife aspects. See Supplementary data—Appendix 3.\nChallenges reported concerned absence of social relationships; managing activities of daily living; lifestyle and\nwell-being priorities; and managing health and well-being.\nConcerns reported included perceived risks/consequences\nof contracting the virus; ‘avoiding people’ and ‘practicing social\ndistancing’; the permanence of the virus without a vaccine;\nand their sense of safety in public places; and the impact\nof lockdown on the personal/family’s livelihood and wider\neconomy.\nPositive aspects reported included increased sense of community and feeling socially more connected with neighbours;\na break from routine; lockdown had made life ‘simpler’,\n‘slower’ and ‘easier’ and removed the pressure of ‘having to\ngo out’; gardening and more time for household tasks; and\nstarting or resuming hobbies.\nDiscussion\nConsidering the challenges faced during the COVID-19\npandemic, this ‘snap-shot’ of older people in Bradford, with\ngood socio-demographic representation, suggests a broadly\npositive picture. Most older people reported low levels of\nhealth anxiety, good health, having low levels of depression\nand anxiety and good access to services.\nMost people did not report worrying about their health.\nThis is reassuring considering the over 70s are considered at\nincreased risk from COVID-19 and regularly portrayed in\nthe media as ‘vulnerable’ [1]. Nevertheless, health worries\nwere expressed when asked specifically about concerns; some\nwere very aware of their increased vulnerability and spoke of\ntheir fear of death from the virus.\nThe majority of people undertook some physical activity\nmost or every day. Most exercised outside every day or most\ndays and were fortunate to have access to outdoor space; the\ngarden was cited as one of the more enjoyable aspects of\nlockdown, providing a space for gardening, relaxing, chatting\nto neighbours and exercise. However, approximately 20%\nreported not doing any physical activity outside and 42%\nwere less physically activity than before restrictions were\nimposed.\nMood outcomes were generally positive. Few participants\nmet the criteria indicative of depression or for anxiety. Our\nfindings indicate that many older people are mentally wellequipped to deal with lockdown scenarios, although this\nshould not negate the impact of social isolation identified in some participants. Possibly, life course experiences,\nincluding growing up during the Second World War years,\nand exposure to previous pandemics (e.g. 1957 and 1968\ninfluenza pandemics) may have contributed to this mental\nresilience.\nApproximately one quarter of the sample reported loneliness some of the time, most of the time or almost all of the\ntime. When reporting their challenges, many participants\nreported how the restrictions had impacted on their relationships and how a lack of contact made them feel isolated and\nlonely.\nService needs were mostly for general practice or pharmacy. Most people that needed to access a service were\nable to do so and subsequently received the required support. For those without household access to food-shopping,\nthe majority had external assistance, mostly from family\nmembers.\nPeople reported numerous challenges. Face-to-face\ncontact was missed. Some reported providing support to\nspouses without family assistance. Worries and concerns\nwere expressed about the virus, in relation to themselves,\ntheir family and their family’s livelihood, for the national and\nglobal economy, and whether a vaccine would be available.\nHowever, over half of all participants could identify positive\naspects of their experience including having more time, a\nbreak from routine and increased engagement with their\nneighbours.\nStrengths of the survey\nThe sample was recruited from a cohort of communitydwelling older people with broad inclusion criteria, encompassing the least and most deprived areas of Bradford. In all,\n77% of those eligible consented to participate.\n344\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/50/2/341/5970510 by guest on 15 April 2021\nLife in lockdown\nTable 2.

Additionally, our findings are\nnot generalizable to older people living with dementia. The\nsample size precluded investigation of subpopulations or of\nany associations.\nConclusions\nThis cross-sectional survey suggests older people generally\nfelt in good health with low levels of health anxiety, anxiety\nand depression during the national lockdown period. The\nmajority of participants reported some positive aspects to\ntheir current situation, suggesting many older people may\nbe well-equipped mentally to deal with lockdown. However, some experienced a negative impact on mental health,\nidentifying an area for intervention if social distancing measures continue. Furthermore, many were exercising less than\nbefore the pandemic, and some spoke of the lasting impact\non their sense of safety in public places. This may not be\neasily resolved if the threat of COVID-19 continues and as\n‘normal’ life returns it cannot be assumed that older people\nwill resume their previous activities.\nBased on our findings, we recommend policy responses\nthat include proactively identifying and addressing COVID19 related mental health problems in later life for those\nexperiencing negative impact, and public health strategies to\npromote safe physical activity should be considered to ameliorate the negative impact of ongoing and future COVID19 restrictions.\nAcknowledgements: We are grateful for the substantial\ncontributions by lay members of the CARE75+ Frailty\nOversight Group who helped identify topics and tested the\nquestionnaire and the substantial contributions of the Bradford District Gold COVID-19 Scientific Advisory Group\n(C-SAG).\nSupplementary Data: Supplementary data mentioned in\nthe text are available to subscribers in Age and Ageing online.\nDeclaration of Conflicts of Interest: None.\n345\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/50/2/341/5970510 by guest on 15 April 2021\nL.

This paper analyses the design and beneficiaries of these policies and, given the distributional pattern of the labour market shock, considers the emerging overall impact on living standards, particularly of low-income households.\n\nJEL I38 - Government Policy; Provision and Effects of Welfare ProgramsJ38 - Public Policy\nIssue Section: Articles\nI. Introduction\nThe UK is in the midst of the biggest shock to economic activity that it has experienced for hundreds of years, one that is rooted in the labour market, driven by the shutting down of certain sectors of the economy and the effects of social distancing rules. At the time of writing, the Bank of England is expecting the economy to shrink by 25 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 (and by 14 per cent for the year as a whole). The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expecting a 35 per cent GDP fall in the second quarter.\n\nThis paper assesses how the crisis is affecting, or is likely to affect, household incomes, and particularly low-income households. In section II, we assess the three core components of the UK government’s strategy to directly protect household incomes: the social security system (including the changes announced once the crisis began), and the new Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (we limit our attention to policies announced by the UK government and do not discuss the (very minor) additional policies announced by the devolved administrations). Using microsimulation methods, we show how well these changes protect households from the financial implications of unemployment. In section III, we discuss the emerging evidence on the impact of the crisis on the distribution of living standards. Although there is not yet a consensus, it seems that the fall in household incomes is more evenly spread across the income distribution than the loss of jobs is distributed across the earnings distribution, and may even be greater among those on higher (pre-crisis) incomes. But we also show that other indicators of financial well-being or living standards than income paint a more worrying story about the ways that the crisis is affecting low-income households.2 We conclude in section IV.\n\nOne limitation of this article is that, given the evidence and data sources that we draw on, it may not reflect the experiences of those people facing the worst disadvantage. We do not make any attempt to analyse, for example, how the analysis is affecting the homeless population. Attention has also been drawn to those whose migration status means that they are not able to claim means-tested social security benefits because they are in the UK on the condition that they have no recourse to public funds (Gower and Kennedy, 2020). Much of the near real-time research that is being done during the coronavirus crisis is through online surveys, and so will miss the digitally excluded. We acknowledge these drawbacks, as well as recognizing that behind the data we describe lie millions of households experiencing genuine hardship and financial strain.\n\nII. The initial UK government response to the coronavirus\n(i) Details of the measures to protect household incomes directly\nLike other countries, the UK government has responded to the current crisis with a set of policies unprecedented in their scope and cost. Indeed, the UK’s has been one of the largest fiscal responses among advanced economies (Hughes et al., 2020). Here, however, we focus on the three elements relating more directly to individual and household incomes: the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (JRS), the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), and changes to the social security system.\n\nThe JRS takes the unprecedented step of directly supporting employers to pay the wage bills of employees ‘furloughed’ without work to do. From April to July, the JRS paid 80 per cent of pre-coronavirus wages, up to £2,500 a month, and on current plans it will continue to pay 80 per cent in August to October, but with a lower cap and some cost-sharing with employers (HMRC, 2020). The idea is that when economic activity picks up, furloughed employees will go back to their pre-crisis work, but this is not a formal condition placed on employers. By mid-June, around 9 million jobs had been supported at some point by the scheme (HMRC, n.d.). The JRS is the largest single part of the government’s response, with the total (gross) cost currently estimated to be around £60 billion (OBR, 2020).\n\nThe SEISS can be seen as a parallel scheme for the self-employed, in that it provides similar levels of income replacement over two sets of grants intended to cover a 6-month period. It is restricted to unincorporated self-employed businesses; those with profits above £50,000 are excluded, as are the newly self-employed (i.e. those without at least one complete tax return in the 3 years up to 2018/19, although there is a separate scheme in Scotland to help this group). By mid-June, 2.6 million claims for the initial grant payment had been made (HMRC, n.d.). The expected total gross cost is £15 billion (OBR, 2020).\n\nThe government has also announced major changes to the social security system.3 The most important was a £20 per week increase in the standard allowance of Universal Credit (UC), an increase that was mirrored in the Working Tax Credit, but not in the contributory (‘new-style’ Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)) or other ‘legacy’ benefits. This change aligns the main adult rate of benefits for an unemployed single adult to the level of Statutory Sick Pay, and means it is at its highest ever level in real terms, and at its highest level relative to average earnings since 1998/99 (see Figure 1). It is noteworthy that the size of the COVID-19 rise in UC was the same for all family types, with no additional help offered to families with children.4 In addition, Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rates (which determine caps on housing support in UC and Housing Benefit for private-sector tenants) were increased, particularly favouring areas in which rents have grown rapidly since 2012 (Judge and Pacitti, 2020). We discuss more who gains from this reform in the next section, but we note now that the detailed rules about UC entitlement mean that the UC increase will not be felt in full by recipients who are affected by the benefit cap (although some of the newly unemployed will benefit from a 9-month grace period), and the LHA increases do not benefit renters in those parts of London that are affected by a national cap on LHA rates. These measures followed some technical changes in the March 2020 Budget that help the self-employed, including the suspension of the minimum income floor in UC (which in effect increases the amount that very low-income self-employed workers can claim), and the removal of the 7-day waiting period that restricted access to contributory ESA (which self-employed people can claim when sick or self-isolating). Local authorities were also given extra funds to provide help with Council Tax bills and to enhance local welfare provision. At the time of announcing the measures, the government said that the boost to social security benefits and tax credits would apply only during the 2020/21 financial year, and the latest estimate is that it will cost £8 billion (OBR, 2020).\n\nFigure 1:\nThe value of the main rate of unemployment-related benefit over time for a single adult\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe value of the main rate of unemployment-related benefit over time for a single adult\n\nNotes: Full-time earnings on the minimum wage calculated based on a 40-hour week.\n\nSource: Figure 16 of Brewer and Handscomb (2020).\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Assessment of what the measures have done to the amount of income protection provided by the state\nGiven that the impact of COVID-19 on household incomes is operating primarily through the labour market, it is important to understand how the tax and benefit system, together with the new policies announced in response to the pandemic, act to protect household incomes in the event of job loss.\n\nFigure 2, from Brewer and Handscomb (2020), shows how replacement rates (these report how much income someone would have if they lost their job expressed as a proportion of the income they had when in work) vary by personal and family characteristics in the 2020–21 system after the new measures, as well as showing median replacement rates under the tax and benefit system that we were due to have from April 2020 in the absence of the emergency benefit increases (Adam et al. (2020) have similar analysis). It shows a great deal of variation in the extent to which the social security system protects people from the financial consequences of unemployment. This reflects at least three factors. First, people’s entitlement to benefits if they do not work will depend on their family circumstances, meaning that two people on similar levels of earning may face different replacement rates (this can be seen in the low replacement rates for single adults without children who have low entitlements to benefits compared to those with children, especially for those under 25). Second, benefits paid in the event of unemployment in the UK are paid at a (low) flat rate, irrespective of previous earnings, and so those on higher earnings tend to face lower replacement rates. Third, asset tests in the calculation of UC mean that families with more than £16,000 of savings will miss out on this support entirely (as shown in, for example, Figure 19 in Brewer and Handscomb (2020)). Such tests have their justifications, but pose challenges to the social security system’s ability to function as a safety net during such a large and rapid economic shock.5\n\nFigure 2:\nFamily income replacement rates when earner stops working and claims benefits by selected characteristics, latest policy: UK, 2020–21\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nFamily income replacement rates when earner stops working and claims benefits by selected characteristics, latest policy: UK, 2020–21\n\nNotes: Replacement rates shown for benefit unit income before housing costs, for adults aged 16–64 who stop working and then claim benefits as entitled. Partner income held constant. Full roll-out of UC and full take-up of benefits assumed.\n\nSource: Brewer and Handscomb (2020).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows that the impact of the coronavirus reforms was to increase the median replacement rate across all workers from 50 to 53 per cent. However, the fact that the increase to UC was a flat-rate £20 per week for all family types means that the maximum UC entitlement for a couple aged 25 or over with two children rose by just 11 per cent (and median replacement rates for workers in these families improved by just 3 ppts), whereas the rate for a single adult under 25 rose by 36 per cent on its 2019 value (and the median replacement rate for this group improved by 8 ppts).\n\nFigure 20 of Brewer and Handscomb (2020) shows that the degree of income protection provided by the social security system is significantly weaker than that provided by the JRS and SEISS. In a world where all employees are placed on the JRS and all self-employed workers receive the SEISS, then the median replacement rate is 91 per cent (it is greater than 80 per cent partly because many people will pay lower effective tax rates after a 20 per cent fall in earnings, partly because some people on the JRS can also claim means-tested support through UC, and partly because of the earnings of working partners for those in couples), compared to 53 per cent without it). This highlights a very important issue of fairness: that those former employees who are not currently benefiting from the JRS—perhaps because they were made redundant, or were ineligible because they had only just started a new job as the crisis hit, or because their employer went bust—will be typically experiencing a far greater hit to their incomes than those (relatively) lucky enough to be furloughed. It also suggests that, as the JRS scheme is reformed during the second half of 2020, any currently furloughed workers who are made redundant may experience large falls in their family income.\n\nIII. What is (likely to be) the impact of COVID-19 on household incomes?\nHigh-quality data on household incomes tends to be released with long lags and so official estimates of income poverty and inequality for current (at the time of writing) financial year, 2020/21, will not be available until March 2022.\n\nUntil then, we have to rely on other sources. We first summarize what is known about the distribution of the initial impact on jobs and earnings based on data from online surveys of individuals or households. We then consider what is known about the impact of the policy measures. After that, we summarize attempts made to combine these and ‘nowcast’ (see Navicke et al., 2014) the entire distribution in a way that allows researchers to isolate the impact of the crisis on the distribution of income. Finally, we look at what we can learn from measures of living standards and financial wellbeing other than income.\n\nBefore doing that, it is worth looking back at how low-income households have fared in previous recessions and economic crises. In the UK recessions of the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, and the early 1990s, the number of individuals in relative poverty—defined as living in a household with less than 60 per cent of median income—fell, driven by large reductions in pensioner poverty (Muriel and Sibieta, 2009). This happened because pensioners get most of their income from sources other than the labour market, and so they tend to move up the income distribution when unemployment rises and earnings from the labour market fall, reducing the number below a floating poverty line. Indicators of poverty that use an anchored poverty threshold increased in all three of these recessions; this is what most people would predict: during recessions and crises, living standards, as a whole, fall.\n\nIn the recession that followed the global financial crisis, relative poverty fell very slightly from 2007/08 to 2012/13, with falls among pensioners that were almost entirely offset by rises among other groups. Unusually, poverty assessed with an anchored poverty line hardly changed from 2007/08 to 2010/11, but then started to rise in 2011/12, especially for those below the state pension age, due to the austerity measures that followed. This reminds us that the policy responses to crises determine the impact on the vulnerable as much as the initial economic shock.\n\n(i) The distributional impact of the initial labour market shock\nAt the time of writing, the usual official estimates of the employment and unemployment rate were still somewhat dated. Timelier data give a better sense of the scale of the impact of restrictions on economic activity from late March on the jobs market, though, with a fall of 612,000 in employee jobs captured by PAYE systems between March and May, an 1.6 million increase (up to 2.8 million) in the claimant count measure of unemployment-related benefit recipients, and a more-than-halving of vacancy numbers (by early May). These numbers, although representing extremely large changes in just 2 months, are without doubt much lower than they would have been had the JRS not been in existence, which has supported 9 million jobs at some point in that same time period. More granular week-by-week data from the Labour Force Survey suggest a more acute contraction in hours worked (which will reflect that those people furloughed should not actually be working) than in employee numbers, with average hours worked falling by around a fifth between the last week of April 2020 and the same week a year earlier.6\n\nIf that gives a sense of scale, then what can we say about the distribution of these effects? Gardiner and Slaughter (2020), who analyse an online survey of 6,000 working-age adults from May 2020, find that 36 per cent of workers in the bottom quintile of pre-coronavirus earnings have experienced job loss, furloughing, or cuts in hours and earnings compared with 16 per cent in the top quintile. Both they and Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) (who draw on a separate online survey fielded in April 2020) show that these outcomes have been more common for those with atypical work arrangements (particularly temporary workers in the case of job loss; and non-salaried, zero-hours contract, and variable hours workers in the case of furloughing). These findings are broadly replicated in Benzeval et al. (2020), who find large and significant reductions in average working hours for women, likely to be reflecting at least in part the disproportionate additional childcare and home schooling hours working mothers have taken on in the face of school and nursery closures (Andrew et al., 2020). And both Benzeval et al. (2020) and Gustafsson (2020) suggest that employment impacts have been concentrated among the youngest and oldest workers. Of course, these findings hide heterogeneity in outcomes among the groups mentioned, reflecting variations between sectors and the ability to work from home (Gustafsson and McCurdy, 2020; Joyce and Xu, 2020), as well as the fact that designated ‘key workers’ (meaning those in jobs which had to continue even when the lockdown was at its most severe) are more likely to be in the bottom half of earners than the top half (Farquharson et al., 2020; Gustafsson and McCurdy, 2020). But the emerging conclusion is that the labour market shock has, so far, hit lower earners much harder than the better paid.\n\nThere is, though, a difference between having low earnings and being on a low income. Brewer and Gardiner (2020) show that the incidence of job loss or reductions in earnings is more common in the second and third quintiles of the working-age income distribution than in the bottom quintile, because around half of adults in the bottom quintile were not in work before the pandemic began. Similarly, Benzeval et al. (2020, Table 5) show that the pattern of declines in earnings—which are greater for low-income households than high-income households—are flatter when looking at all households, compared to when restricted just to households who had some earnings pre-pandemic. The conclusion that ‘falls in market income affect only those engaged with the market’ is uncontroversial, but it is important when considering the impact on low-income households.\n\n(ii) The direct impact of the government’s coronavirus measures\nWe consider here the three major measures in turn.\n\nBroadly speaking, and relative to a counterfactual of job loss, the JRS will benefit those employees whose employers furloughed them. The fact that support via the JRS is based on a percentage of prior earnings up to a high cap will mean that higher earners who have been furloughed benefit most in absolute terms, but less as a fraction of previous earnings. Survey data suggest that being furloughed is more common among low earners than high earners (Figure 1 of Gardiner and Slaughter (2020)), but that, among all (working-age) adults, furloughing has been most common in the middle of the (pre-crisis) household income distribution (see Figure 3 of Brewer and Gardiner (2020)); this is because low earners are not found only in low-income households. Brewer and Tasseva (2020, Figure 1) estimate the impact of the JRS on household incomes, assuming that the counterfactual is that the worker would have no earnings at all, and find that the impact of the JRS is slightly greater, as a percentage of disposable income, in (pre-crisis) income decile groups 6–9 than it is in 2–5, but that its impact tails off in the top decile group because of the £2,500 per month cap, and is much smaller in the lowest-income decile group because fewer adults were in work pre-crisis (Bronka et al. (2020, Figure 3) have similar conclusions). This suggests that the distributional impact of the JRS, when considered across all individuals, is currently neutral or slightly regressive (as in, pro-rich).\n\nFigure 3:\nChange in household income and spending compared to before the coronavirus outbreak began, by 18–65-year-old family income quintile before coronavirus (exc. retired and students): UK, 6–11 May 2020\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nChange in household income and spending compared to before the coronavirus outbreak began, by 18–65-year-old family income quintile before coronavirus (exc. retired and students): UK, 6–11 May 2020\n\nNotes: Base = all adults aged 18–65 with valid income data (apart from the ‘all’ category). Family income distribution based on equivalized, disposable benefit unit incomes among 18–65-year-old adults, excluding families containing retired adults or non-working adult students (see the annex to Brewer and Gardiner (2020) for details). Right-hand panel excludes those responding ‘don’t know’ or ‘prefer not to say’, and is based on assigning those in income and spending change categories values as follows: +/–>25 per cent = 33 per cent; +/–10–25 per cent = 17.5 per cent; +/–<10 per cent = 5 per cent.\n\nSource: Brewer and Gardiner (2020).\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, there were few data on who was claiming the SEISS (but Blundell and Machin (2020) report on the extent to which self-employed workers’ businesses are affected by the pandemic and on what sort of self-employed workers said that they intended to claim it). Self-employment is most common at the very bottom and very top of the household income distribution, but the restrictions to SEISS access will be likely to affect both of these groups, with those on lower incomes less likely to have filed tax returns, and some of those on higher incomes missing out due to high profits or incorporation, so it is possible that the greatest impact of this scheme will be felt in the middle of the income distribution.\n\nThe increased generosity of means-tested benefits announced in response to COVID-19 will help those who were receiving UC or tax credits before the crisis, as well as the newly unemployed or those whose earnings have fallen who go on to claim UC. Brewer and Handscomb (2020) shows the ‘overnight’ distributional impact of these changes. As would be expected from an increase in means-tested support, the majority of the beneficiaries are in the bottom half of the income distribution and, on average, the changes provide a boost to family incomes of nearly 5 per cent in the bottom quartile (Brewer and Tasseva (2020, Figure 4) comes to a similar conclusion, although it expresses gains as a fraction of before-housing-costs income, meaning that the gains are shown to be a smaller fraction of income).\n\n(iii) The overall impact on the income distribution\nAt the time of writing, there were only three studies that suggested how the crisis might be affecting the distribution of income. Brewer and Gardiner (2020) report results from a survey that asked working-age adults about changes in household income between February and May 2020. They show that the experience of a fall in income is distributed surprisingly evenly across the (pre-coronavirus) income distribution: 37 per cent of adults in the bottom 40 per cent of working-age family-level incomes reported income falls, as did 35 per cent of adults in the top 40 per cent. Indeed, experience of increases in income was actually most common among adults at the bottom of the pre-coronavirus income distribution; this could be due to the increases in benefit entitlement.\n\nThis study did not quantify the scale of the income changes. But two studies have used nowcasting techniques to simulate the distributional impact of the crisis by estimating the distribution of household incomes and comparing that to a counterfactual world where the crisis did not happen. These are: Brewer and Tasseva (2020), who use the data on job loss and falls in earnings analysed in Benzeval et al. (2020) to estimate how the crisis has affected household incomes in April 2020, and Bronka et al. (2020), who use data collected from an expert survey of 2,644 economists to estimate how the crisis has affected incomes in the full financial year 2020/21.7\n\nBoth studies estimate, on average, that the crisis reduces household incomes, and the falls in income are greater in proportional terms for households who would have been at the top of the income distribution. However, the estimated impacts vary markedly, with Brewer and Tasseva (2020) forecasting a 9 per cent fall, and Bronka et al. (2020) a 1 per cent fall. The most likely explanation is that the former paper is an assessment of how COVID-19 is affecting incomes in April 2020 only, and the latter is making an assessment over the 2020/21 financial year. Poverty rates against a fixed poverty line are simulated to rise in Brewer and Tasseva (2020)’s analysis (from 17.4 to 19.8 per cent; Table A.4).\n\n(iv) The impact on wider measures of household living standards\nTo come to a full understanding of the impact of the current crisis on living standards across the distribution, and poverty, it is helpful also to go beyond measures of living standards other than income.\n\nFigure 3, from Brewer and Gardiner (2020), shows how adults report both income and spending to have changed between February and May 2020, and find a strong distributional gradient: 38 per cent of adults in the top (pre-coronavirus, working-age) income quintile have experienced no income falls but have had a reduction in spending compared to just 12 per cent of those in the bottom quintile. Consumption is often viewed as an alternative and more detailed lens on living standards, compared to income and income-based poverty measures (see Brewer et al. (2017) and Gardiner et al. (2017), for example), and in normal times we would usually interpret falls in spending as indicative of a decline in household resources. Here, it seems likely that the fall in spending reflects more an inability to spend money, given that much of the hospitality, non-food retail, and leisure sectors had been shut down from late March to May 2020. If so, then, for many families, especially the better off, falls in spending probably reflect ‘enforced saving’ (Corry (2020) shows that better-off families devoted more of their spending to the sectors that were shut down). This is matched by subjective data: Brewer and Gardiner (2020) report that adults in the (pre-coronavirus, working-age) top quintile were as likely to say that their personal financial situation has improved as worsened (23 per cent compared to 22 per cent), whereas in the bottom quintile the figures are 10 per cent vs 36 per cent. Adults in the (pre-coronavirus, working-age) bottom quintile were also more likely to say that they were now more concerned about finances than they were before the crisis than were adults in the top quintile. And these results are matched by analysis in Bangham and Leslie (2020), which show that low-income working-age families are more likely (than high-income families) to have reduced their saving rate, or increased their use of consumer debt, or borrowed from friends and family. Benzeval et al. (2020) also find the same patterns of mitigation behaviours among those whose earnings have fallen, with running down savings being most common in the bottom income quintile group, and borrowing more or receiving loans from family and friends being most common in the bottom two quintile groups. Overall, data so far strongly suggest that high-income families are more likely to have seen a strengthening of the household’s financial position, and that the implications of this crisis are more serious for the living standards of lower-income (working-age) families than higher-income ones.\n\nIV. Summary and conclusions\nThis article has analysed the UK government’s three main policies to protect directly household incomes during the coronavirus crisis. We have also considered the emerging evidence on the overall impact of the pandemic on the living standards of low-income households, given what is known at the time of writing about the distributional pattern of the labour market shock and the major policy responses.\n\nSo far, it seems that a bottom-heavy labour market hit has not translated into as bottom-heavy a hit to family incomes, partly due to the success of the (strengthened) social security safety net in cushioning the blow—at least to some extent, and for some—and partly because many at the bottom of the income distribution are unaffected by job loss. On the other hand, looking at wider measures of living standards reveals a more concerning picture, with those in (pre-crisis) lower-income families being far more likely to have taken on new debt, or borrowed from friends or family, or cut back on saving; this reflects not that the income falls have been greater than among higher-income households but that they have been less likely to have experienced a (probably enforced) reduction in spending. This, in addition to evidence on people’s assessments of their own situation, suggests that the crisis is having more marked negative effects on the living standards—considered broadly—of lower-income working-age families than of higher-income families. Furthermore, this comes after several years where incomes have grown very slowly at the bottom of the income distribution, particularly measuring incomes after housing costs have been deducted (Bourquin et al., 2020).\n\nMost of the evidence to date comes from surveys of working-age adults. We surmise, though, that those above working age will be less affected, in financial terms, by the coronavirus crisis than those of working age. Lower-income people over the pension age in UK get the majority of their income from the government in social security benefits, rather than the labour market. And although asset prices have fallen and interest rates are very low (both of which tend to reduce the income that people can get from their investments), this crisis is not rooted in the financial markets, as was the recession after the global financial crisis.\n\nThese findings offer important lessons for policy-makers. As the government considers how policies should develop over the recovery phase of this crisis—including what (if anything) should replace the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme after October 2020, the introduction of support to help unemployed people return to work, and any extension of the currently temporary £20 per week uplift to Universal Credit or other changes to welfare benefits—policy-makers should be particularly focused on providing support to those on lower incomes where the changes in overall financial circumstances have been the most concerning so far. Further down the track, any fiscal consolidation after this crisis that is needed to reduce the government’s deficit should be designed with an eye to those whose overall financial situation has been least affected by the crisis. Appreciating the differential impacts of this crisis on different groups within society will allow policy-makers to support the recovery most effectively, and prevent the coronavirus crisis, as far as is possible, from becoming a long-term crisis in living standards.\n\nBrewer acknowledges support from the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex (award number ES/S012486/1).",

These measures\nare vital in decreasing mortality and reducing the overburdening of health care systems.\nAccording to one estimate, mitigation measures can save at least 20 million lives and, when\nthey are adopted early enough (at 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population per week), up to 38.7\nmillion lives globally (Walker et al. 2020). As Dr. Deborah Birx, who is coordinating the\ncoronavirus response in the US summarized on April 1, “There’s no magic bullet. There’s no\nmagic vaccine or therapy. It’s just behaviors. Each of our behaviors, translating into\nsomething that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days.”2 However,\neffectuating these measures, and ensuring people maintain social distance and refrain from\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

As written in an\neditorial in Science after the 1918 Pandemic that killed millions worldwide, “It does not lie in\nhuman nature for a man who thinks he has only a slight cold to shut himself up in rigid\nisolation as a means of protecting others on the bare chance that his cold may turn out to be a\nreally dangerous infection” (Soper 1919).\nThis study answers two crucial questions in relation to these mitigation measures. First, it\nstudies to what extent people have already complied with the measures. Second, it analyzes\nwhich of the possible mechanisms grounded in social science have actually shaped\ncompliance. The answers to these questions can shed light on the extent to which the\nmeasures have been effective in achieving the desired change in behaviour, which can\nmitigate the spread of the virus. Moreover, they can help guide policies that seek to improve\ncompliance.\nThe study focuses on two core contagion mitigation measures in the United States. One of\nthese measures focuses on social distancing, which looks at whether people keep a safe\ndistance from others (in most countries this has been defined at somewhere between 1,5-2\nmeters) and whether they refrain from meeting people outside of their own household. The\nother measure focuses on staying at home (which has been issued under different names,\nincluding stay at home orders, lockdowns, and shelter in place). While there is variation in\nthe exact details of such measures, their core substance is that people are to stay at home and\nonly go out for what are deemed essential activities (which have been defined differently in\ndifferent jurisdictions).\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n3\nLiterature overview\nThe study contributes to the emerging body of empirical work on the factors that influence\nhow people respond to the COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, many studies do not\nfocus on compliance with the measures themselves, but on the psychological impact of the\nmeasures, or other related psychological dimensions. Some of the earlier work, which came\nout when countries were still considering whether to take these measures, has assessed\nwhether people support the measures, how they perceive the efficacy of the measures, and\nwhat explains such support (Kushner Gadarian, Wallace Goodman, and Pepinsky 2020,\nMaekelae et al. 2020). In addition, Zettler et al. (2020) examined what factors affect\nacceptance of personal restrictions due to COVID-19 measures, but did not measure actual\nbehavior and compliance with these measures. Moreover, experimental studies have\nexamined how different messages on the importance of COVID-19 mitigation measures\naffect self-reported intentional behavior to comply with these measures (Lunn et al. 2020,\nEverett et al. 2020).\nThere are some studies that have similarly asked people to self-report about their behaviour\nsince measures have been adopted. These studies have not looked at what explains variation\nin such compliance. A recent Dutch survey, for instance, reported descriptive statistics on\nhow self-reported behaviour has changed over time, and showed promising rates of\ncompliance with social distancing measures. However, this study did not examine what\nfactors influenced behavioral change (I&O Research and Universiteit Twente 2020). Another\nexample is a study, reported in the New York Times, that used de-identified cell-phone data to\ncapture reductions in the average distance travelled after measures were adopted, compared\nto before the measures were adopted, in a specific area.(Glanz et al. 2020, April 2). This work\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n4\nshowed that in the US, there is a marked reduction in movement in places where measures\nwere adopted, compared to places that did not adopt measures. This sort of study provides\nreliable data on how much people move, but it does not provide data about compliance with\nthe measures themselves, nor does it assess what shapes compliance.\nSeveral recent studies did look at which factors influence compliance. These studies focused\non particular influences, for example on the effects of political orientation (Harper et al.\n2020, Kushner Gadarian, Wallace Goodman, and Pepinsky 2020), social responsibility, social\ntrust, self-interest (Oosterhoff and Palmer 2020), and attitudes about COVID-19 severity or\nfear of the virus (Oosterhoff and Palmer 2020, Harper et al. 2020).\nIn sum, there is emerging empirical research about people’s attitudes and responses to the\nmeasures. However, there are no studies yet that look at whether people comply with or\nviolate the measures, and that systematically assess what factors shape such compliance.\nHere, it is vital that the analysis of compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures uses a\ncomprehensive compliance approach that draws on the behavioral mechanisms and\ninterventions that are known to affect rule-compliant behavior based on insights from prior\ncompliance research (Van Rooij and Sokol 2021 (Forthcoming)).\nPresent study\nThis study analyzes how people have responded to the measures adopted to mitigate the\nspread of COVID-19 in the US. As of April 1, 2020, approximately 70 percent of all\nAmericans were subject to a stay at home measure.3 Although the terms “safer at home” and\n“shelter in place” were used interchangeably within the United States,4 measures generally\nallowed people to leave their home for essential activities, such as grocery shopping or doctor\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n5\nvisits.5 Although a federal stay at home directive was never issued, many governors instituted\nstatewide measures advising people to stay at home.6 Where a state order was not issued,\nmany officials at the county and city level instituted similar measures.7 Social distancing\nmeasures, which advised citizens to maintain a six-foot space between themselves and other\npeople,\n8 and generally included the closure of schools and non-essential businesses,9\naccompanied stay at home/shelter in place orders in most jurisdictions. The majority of social\ndistancing recommendations were issued in March, with President Trump officially\nrecommending social distancing guidelines on March 10, 2020.10\nStates have used different approaches to ensure compliance with these measures. Many\nstates, including, Washington, California, and New York, have adopted sanctions (i.e., the\nimposition of fines and/or jail sentences) for offenders, seeking to deter people into\ncompliance. To enforce these sanctions, some localities, such as Los Angeles, have increased\nlaw enforcement patrol.11 States have also focused on enhancing people’s awareness of the\nmeasures. In Washington State, for instance, reminding alleged violators of what the\nmeasures are is a first priority before issuing citations or actual criminal action.\n12 In many\nlocalities, authorities have made it harder for people to gather in public, closing down public\nvenues, and in New York City even taking away basketball hoops to keep people from\ngathering to play.13 Authorities also made moral appeals. For instance, in California,\nGovernor Gavin Newsom discussed that 25 million people would be affected, and he\nappealed to people’s sense of duty: “There's a social contract here, people I think recognize\nthe need to do more to meet this situation.”14 Leaders also argued that the measures could\nhelp “flatten the curve” (of infections) and prevent hospitals being unable to provide the care\nneeded.15\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

These\nhave been operationalized on the basis of insights about compliance, and why people obey or\nbreak rules from a psychological, criminological, sociological, and economic perspective\n(Van Rooij and Sokol 2021 (Forthcoming), Friedman 2016, Feldman 2018).\nThe first type of factor we expected to influence compliance with the mitigation measures is\nsubstantive moral support for the measures. This refers to the extent to which people agree\nwith the substance of the measures (Tyler 1997, 2006). As the virus seems to affect some\npeople disproportionately (Zhou et al. 2020, Jung et al. 2020, Weiss and Murdoch 2020), for\ninstance by having more serious and lethal effects for the elderly or for those with preexisting conditions and much less so for younger people, it is important to know how\nrespondents see the threat to themselves and loved ones, as well as public health generally.\nWe assessed whether people morally supported the measures themselves. Finally, we looked\nat whether people found the overall approach taken by authorities to be consistent and\nadequate. We used these insights to study whether more moral support for the measures was\nassociated with higher compliance.\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n7\nThe second factor with a potential influence on compliance is the costs of compliance and\nstrain that people might incur following the measures. With higher costs of compliance,\nrational choice theory would predict that compliance will be lower (Paternoster and Simpson\n1993, Donovan and Blake 1992). In addition, strain and negative emotions people may have\nbecause of the measures may push them to cope through rule violating behavior (Agnew\n1992, 2006, Agnew et al. 2002, Agnew and White 1992, Baron 2004, Piquero and Sealock\n2004, Botchkovar, Tittle, and Antonaccio 2009). Studies about emotions people may\nexperience during quarantine also show that negative emotions may lead to lower compliance\nwith quarantine measures (Brooks et al. 2020). We used these insights to study whether\nhigher costs predicted less compliance, and also whether negative emotions predicted lower\ncompliance.\nThe third type of factor with a potential influence on compliance is the deterrent effect of the\nmeasures. General deterrence theory holds that, when there is a greater certainty and severity\nof punishment, people become more likely to comply with rules (Becker 1968, Polinsky and\nShavell 2000, Shavell 1991). Empirical studies have shown that certainty of punishment is\nespecially important, and for criminal behavior, stronger punishment only starts to have an\neffect after there is a threshold level of such certainty (Nagin 2013, Brown 1978, Chamlin\n1991). Perceptual deterrence research also shows that deterrence is subjective (Apel 2013,\nDecker, Wright, and Logie 1993) and that research needs to look at the perceptions people\nhave of certainty, and the relative impact that punishment has on their lives (Grasmick and\nBryjak 1980). These insights were used to assess whether higher certainty and higher severity\nof sanctions have a deterrent effect in improving compliance.\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n8\nThe fourth type of factor with a potential influence on compliance is people’s capacity to\ncomply with the measures. Logically, compliance is lower when people are practically unable\nto do as the measures demand. Another aspect of the capacity to comply is whether people\nhave sufficient knowledge to know what is expected from them (Darley, Carlsmith, and\nRobinson 2001, Kim 1999, Van Rooij 2021 (Forthcoming)). Moreover, the more unclear the\nrules are, the harder it is for people to know what is expected of them and thus the harder it is\nto comply (Feldman and Teichman 2009). We used these insights to study whether practical\ncapacity to obey the rules had an effect on compliance, and whether the perceived clarity of\nthe measures predicted compliance.\nThe fifth type of factor with a potential influence on compliance is whether people have the\nopportunity to violate the measures. Here, we follow insights from routine activities theory\n(Cohen and Felson 1979, Osgood et al. 1996, Spano and Freilich 2009) and situational crime\nprevention (Clarke 1980, Clarke 2005) that show that there is less rule breaking when there\nare less practical opportunities to do so. We used these insights to study whether the\nopportunity to violate the measures predicted compliance.\nThe sixth type of factor with a potential influence on compliance is people’s impulsivity. The\nquestionnaire included this measure in light of criminological findings that show that high\nlevels of impulsivity predict deviant and rule breaking behavior (Gottfredson and Hirschi\n1990, Pratt and Cullen 2000, 2005, Pratt and Llouyd 2021 (forthcoming), Vazsonyi, Mikuška,\nand Kelley 2017). We assessed whether higher impulsivity predicted compliance.\nThe seventh type of factor with a potential influence on compliance is descriptive social\nnorms. Research shows that the more people see others comply with rules or requests, the\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n9\nmore likely they will comply themselves. Research additionally shows that the more people\nsee others violate or disobey, the more likely they will follow suit (Cialdini et al. 2006,\nCialdini and Goldstein 2004, Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griskevicius 2008, Schultz et al. 2007).\nWe assessed whether perceptions of how others follow the rules predicted respondents’ own\ncompliance.\nThe eighth type of factor with a potential influence on compliance is obligation to obey the\nlaw (“OOL”) and procedural justice (“PJ”). This follows from a large body of work in\npsychology and criminology that shows that people who feel more obligated to obey the law\nare more likely to comply. Naturally, one may feel obligated to obey the law for a variety of\nreasons. On the one hand, OOL has a normative dimension; people voluntarily obey the rules\nif they have been made and enforced in a procedurally just way by a properly-established\nauthority (Fine et al. 2020, Fine et al. 2016, Tyler 2017, Tyler 1997, 2006, Nagin and Telep\n2017). Studies of OOL have found that when people think that such authorities who create\nand enforce rules do so in a procedurally fair and just manner, there is heightened OOL\n(Tyler 2017, Tyler 1997, 2006, Walters and Bolger 2019, Nagin and Telep 2017). Yet there is\nalso a non-normative dimension to OOL, which exists when people have a sense to of duty to\nobey the rules out of a sense of coercion, thinking that they have no other choice but to obey.\nHere a key element is that people may see an obligation to obey the rules because they fear\nthe authorities (Posch et al. 2020). We used these insights to study whether normative\nobligation to obey the law (Norm-OOL), non-normative obligation to obey the law (NonNOOL), and procedural justice (PJ) predicted higher compliance.\nThe ninth type of factor with a potential influence on compliance is people’s political\norientation. People increasingly live in echo-chambers, where they get news from traditional\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n10\nand social media sources which are aligned with a particular political orientation (Prior 2013,\nBaum and Groeling 2008, Fletcher and Nielsen 2017, Spohr 2017). These echo chambers can\ndetermine the way people learn about the pandemic and the measures taken to contain it. As\nsuch, their political orientation may come to determine how they view the measures, the\nauthorities (Fine, Rowan, and Simmons 2019) and eventually, whether they comply. This line\nof argumentation can also be found in an earlier COVID-19 study, which found that US\npolitical partisanship was the most important predictor of policy preferences and health\nbehavior before more restrictive stay at home measures were in place (Kushner Gadarian,\nWallace Goodman, and Pepinsky 2020). We assessed whether political orientation predicted\ncompliance.\nMethod\nSample\nParticipants (N = 600) were recruited through the online platform Prolific Academic. Data\ncollection took place on April 3, 2020. Participants were eligible if they were U.S. residents\nand had lived in a state that on or before April 1st, 2020 (i.e., at least 2 days prior to the\nstudy’s initiation): 1) had issued a stay at home or shelter in place directive, or 2) where over\n50 percent of the state’s population was subject to such a directive. As a result of the\ninclusion criteria, the study sampled participants in 35 of the 50 states in the U.S (Appendix).\nParticipants were paid $3.00 for participation. 25 participants were excluded because they\nprovide professional care for COVID-19 patients, and seven participants were excluded\nbecause they failed the attention check.16 Table 1 shows the characteristics of the final sample\n(N = 570).\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

The following descriptive statistics were recorded: age, gender,\nnationality, information on residency (country, state, city), education, household residents\n(total number and number of dependents), race/ethnicity, insurance status, and socioeconomic status before and after COVID-19 (MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status;\nAdler et al. 2000). Furthermore, participants indicated whether they provided professional\ncare for COVID-19 patients, whether they visited friends or family over the age of 75 on a\nregular basis prior to the outbreak of the virus, and whether they or anyone they knew had\nunderlying health issues that made them more at-risk for contracting COVID-19. Finally,\nparticipants were asked to indicate their trust in science on a single item taken from McCright\net al. (2013), on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “completely distrust” to (5)\n“completely trust.” Trust in media reporting was questioned similarly to trust in science.\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n12\nCompliance with COVID-19 measures. Compliance was measured with regard to two main\nCOVID-19 mitigation measures: social distancing and stay at home. Four items (α = .75)\nmeasured whether participants complied with social distancing. Compliance with staying at\nhome was measured with a single item. Participants answered a single item on a 7-point\nLikert scale ranging from (1) “never” to (7) “always.” For social distancing, three items were\nreverse scored. Mean scores were calculated both for social distancing and stay at home\nmeasures together (α = .76) and for the two measures separately. Higher values indicate\ngreater compliance with these COVID-19 mitigation measures.\nSubstantive moral support. Substantive moral support was measured on three\nsubscales: perceived threat, specific moral alignment, and support for current policies.\nPerceived threat. Perceived threat was measured using three items (α = .89) on which\nparticipants indicated to what extent they believed COVID-19 was a threat to themselves or\nothers, using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “very strongly disagree” to (7) “very\nstrongly agree.”\nSpecific moral alignment. Specific moral alignment was measured using two items (α\n= .96) on which participants indicated to what extent they believed people should follow these\nCOVID-19 mitigation measures, using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “very strongly\ndisagree” to (7) “very strongly agree.”\nSupport for current policies. Support for current policies was measured using three\nitems (α = .28) on which participants indicated to what extent they supported the authorities in\nadopting these COVID-19 mitigation measures, using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1)\n“very strongly disagree” to (7) “very strongly agree.” One item was reverse coded. The mean\nscore was calculated, and higher values indicate more support for the authorities in adopting\nthese COVID-19 measures. One item correlated poorly. If removed, Cronbach’s alpha rose to\nα = .85, so it was decided to exclude this item from further analyses.\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n13\nCosts of compliance and strain. Costs of compliance and strain were measured on two\nsub-scales: costs of compliance and negative emotions.\nCosts of compliance. Participants indicated on five items (α = .78) how likely it was\nthat compliance with these COVID-19 mitigation measures would have a negative impact on\nthem. Participants answered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “extremely unlikely” to\n(7) “extremely likely.”\nNegative emotions. Negative emotions due to COVID-19 was measured on six items\n(α = .88) assessing different negative emotions, rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1)\n“very strongly disagree” to (7) “very strongly agree.” Means were calculated, and higher values\nindicated higher negative emotions.\nDeterrence. Deterrence was measured for the two COVID-19 mitigation measures\nseparately. Two items (social distancing α = .71, stay at home α = .84, combined α = .87)\nmeasured certainty of apprehension and punishment for violating these COVID-19 measures,\nanswered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “extremely improbable” to (7) “extremely\nprobable.” Furthermore, for severity of punishment, participants indicated how much suffering\nwould be inflicted if they were punished for violating each of the two COVID-19 measures\n(social distancing and stay at home combined α = .88). Responses were recorded using a 6-\npoint Likert scale ranging from (1) “extreme suffering” to (6) “no suffering at all.” Lower\nscores indicated higher suffering.\nCapacity to comply. The capacity to comply was measured using two sub-scales:\npractical capacity to comply and perceived clarity of such measures.\nPractical capacity to comply. Three items (α = .60) measured to what extent\nparticipants were practically able to comply with these COVID-19 mitigation measures, on a\n7-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “very strongly disagree” to (7) “very strongly agree.”\nOne item correlated poorly (α = .68 if deleted). This item was excluded from further analyses.\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n14\nPerceived clarity of current measures. Furthermore, participants were asked whether\nthe COVID-19 measures were clear to them (“The measures authorities have adopted to reduce\nthe spread of the Coronavirus are…”) and answered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1)\n“extremely unclear” to (7) “extremely clear.” Higher scores indicated greater clarity.\nOpportunity to violate. Five items (α = .82) measured to what extent participants had\nthe opportunity to violate these COVID-19 mitigation measures. Responses were recorded\nusing a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “very strongly disagree” to (7) “very strongly\nagree.”\nImpulsivity. Impulsivity was measured using a subset of five items (α = .76) taken\nfrom the 8-item impulse control subscale from the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory (WAI;\nWeinberger and Schwartz 1990). The items were answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging\nfrom (1) “false” to (5) “true.” One item was reverse coded, and means were calculated. Higher\nscores indicated greater impulsivity.\nDescriptive social norms. Participants rated the extent to which people they know\ncomply with these COVID-19 mitigation measures (one item for each measure, α = .94), on a\n7-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “very strongly disagree” to (7) “very strongly agree.”\nHigher scores indicated participants thought people they know are highly compliant with\nmitigation measures.\nObligation to obey the law (OOL) and Procedural Justice (PJ). To assess OOL and\nPJ, the survey has three sub-scales: normative obligation to obey the law, non-normative\nobligation to obey the law, and procedural justice.\nNormative obligation to obey: Normative obligation to obey was measured with a\nsingle item, “I feel like it is sometimes okay to break the law,” on a 7-point Likert scale ranging\nfrom (1) “strongly agree” to (7) “strongly disagree.” This item was created for the current study\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3582626\nPreprint not peer reviewed\n15\nbased on existent work (e.g., (Estévez and Emler 2010, Reisig, Bratton, and Gertz 2007, Fine\net al. 2020). Higher scores indicated greater normative obligation to obey the law.\nNon-normative obligation to obey: Non-normative obligation was measured using a\nsingle item, “I only obey the authorities handling the Coronavirus because I am afraid of them”\n(adapted for COVID19 following (Posch et al. 2020, Tankebe, Reisig, and Wang 2016)). This\nitem was measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1) “very strongly disagree” to (7)\n“very strongly agree.” Higher scores indicated greater non-normative obligation to obey.\nProcedural justice (PJ). Procedural justice was measured using items adapted from\nprior measures of procedural justice used in several studies of the police (Baker and Gau 2018,\nGau 2014, Tyler 1997, Wolfe et al. 2016). Three items (α = .93) measured PJ in creating these\nCOVID-19 mitigation measures. Four items (α = .93) measured PJ in enforcing these COVID19 mitigation measures. The items were answered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from (1)\n“very strongly disagree” to (7) “very strongly agree.” The seven items for PJ in creating the\nand enforcing the measures were combined in a single PJ scale (α = .95). Higher values\nindicated greater procedural justice.\nPolitical orientation. Political orientation was measured with a single item adapted from prior\nresearch (Hasson et al. (2018), Fine, Rowan, and Simmons (2019), Wojcik et al. (2015)). The\nquestion was answered on a 4-point scale, ranging from (1) “very progressive” to (4) “very\nconservative.” Participants could also respond with “prefer not to say;” these participants were\nexcluded from the analyses that included political orientation.17\nResults\nDescriptive statistics.\nTables 2 and 3 respectively show the descriptive statistics of the control and\nindependent variables.\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an\nemergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review.\nMethods: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on\nmaternal health and provide an overview of the most signifcant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles\nwere considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving\nupdates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the\ndirect or indirect efects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing\nof pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most\nevidence.\nResults: The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at\na heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk\ntransmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe\nincreases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially\nharmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic\nthan men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands.\nConclusion: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse\noutcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced signifcant struggles. Further resources\nshould be directed towards quality epidemiological studies.\nPlain English summary: The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through\ninfection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic\ncircumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a\ncomprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and\n© The Author(s) 2021.

Reprod Health (2021) 18:10 Page 2 of 39\nBackground\nCOVID-19, frst documented in Wuhan, China at the end\nof 2019 [1], has rapidly spread across the globe, infecting\ntens of millions of individuals [2]. While sex-disaggregated\ndata on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n(SARS-CoV-2) mortalities suggest it poses more severe\nhealth outcomes for men than women [3], there are concerns that the disease could disproportionately burden\nwomen in a social and economic sense. Furthermore, it is\na particularly salient question whether pregnant women\nare more susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 or have\nmore severe disease outcomes. Outside of direct infection,\nthe impact of the pandemic and pandemic-control policies\non healthcare infrastructure, societies, and the global economy may also afect maternal health. Pregnant women and\nnew mothers are a unique population, with particular mental and physical healthcare needs who are also particularly\nvulnerable to issues such as domestic violence. Finally, the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be contextspecifc, and difer depending on a variety of country-specifc factors. A global pandemic is likely to only reveal its\nconsequences after signifcant time passes, and literature\npublished before or immediately after policies are implemented may not capture all relevant outcomes. Te goal of\nthis scoping review is to synthesize the current literature\non both the direct consequences of contracting COVID19 during pregnancy and the indirect consequences of the\npandemic for pregnant individuals and mothers, taking\ninto account the myriad ways in which containment and\nprevention measures have disrupted daily life.\nMethods\nTis scoping review followed the framework outlined by\nArksey and O’Malley [4], in order to map the existing literature on the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19\non maternal health, incorporating the following 5 stages:\nIdentify research question\nHow has the COVID-19 pandemic directly and indirectly\nimpacted maternal health globally?\nIdentify relevant types of evidence\nLiterature published in English from January 1st, 2020\nto September 11, 2020 was included in the search. Te\nsearch strategy involved the algorithm used by the\nMaternal Health Task Force’s Buzz, a biweekly e-newsletter presenting current research relevant to maternal\nhealth. Hand searches were conducted in PubMed using\nMeSH terms (see Additional fle  1), along with broader\nsearches of “COVID” and “corona” followed by the terms:\n“pregnant”, “maternal”, “women”, “reproductive”, “economic”, “social”, “indirect”, “direct.” Google Scholar was\nalso searched using these terms to capture grey literature, such as news articles and working papers that have\nnot yet completed the peer review process. Tis scoping\nreview aimed to capture rapidly evolving evidence in a\ntimely manner, including issues not yet addressed in wellfunded, epidemiological studies. Te snowball method\nof consulting sources’ bibliographies was used for certain articles to supplement referenced evidence. Te\nsearch strategy as outlined above was not registered with\nPROSPERO.\nStudy selection\nLiterature was included if published during the time\nframe outlined above and primarily assessed the direct\nor indirect efects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal health. Search terms utilized did not directly address\nneonatal health, but publications on topics relevant to\nboth populations (transmission, breastfeeding, maternity care practices) were also included if returned by the\nsearch terms. Case reports, case series, qualitative studies, systematic and scoping reviews, and meta-analyses\nbreastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines\nfor labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty\nand unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic\nimpact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as\nclinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely refects an\nincrease in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike.\nWomen were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to\nepidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and\nmore focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.\nKeywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Maternal health, Newborn health, Maternal-child transmission, Mental health,\nGender equity\nKotlar et al. Reprod Health (2021) 18:10 Page 3 of 39\nwere included. As some publications included were systematic or scoping reviews or meta-analyses, there was\nsome duplication in data on which publications were\nbased. Te article containing the more complete description of the data was used for data charting. Sources were\nexcluded if they consisted only of recommendations for\nfuture research. Predictive research was excluded if it\nconsisted only of speculation referencing past epidemics but included if based on quantitative methods. News\narticles, reports, and other grey literature were included\nif they contained quantifable evidence (case reports,\nsurvey results, qualitative analyses).After reading full\ntexts and synthesizing relevant evidence, literature was\norganized thematically. Temes were discussed and\ndecided upon by all four authors. Temes that refected\npotential impacts of COVID-19, but for which no quantitative evidence existed were excluded from the review.\nOf 200 peer-reviewed articles, 129 were excluded; 7 did\nnot pertain to maternal health or COVID-19, 3 were\nresponses to articles, and 199 were commentaries, editorials, or practice guidelines which did not contain relevant evidence. Of 196 articles from the grey literature,\n172 articles were excluded; 124 did not pertain to maternal health or COVID-19, and 48 did not contain objective information. See Fig. 1 for a visual representation of\ninclusion and exclusion.\nChart the data\n71 peer-reviewed articles and 24 publications from the\ngrey literature were included from the original search.\nTwo peer-reviewed articles that contradicted earlier fndings that were published after September 11, 2020 were\nadded. Publications included represented a wide range of\nmethodologies including case reports, case series, observational studies, letters to the editor, and news articles.\nTe authors developed a rubric of major themes that\narose in the literature and recorded standard information\nincluding location, sampling method, and size of sample,\nand key fndings of each study (see Table  1). An adaptive thematic analysis [5] was applied using the following\nsteps. Te authors identifed themes in the literature by\na reading and discussing each article included. Articles\nwere then coded independently by two authors. All four\nauthors discussed each code and grouped codes into fnal\nthemes.\nCollate, summarize, and report results\nNarrative descriptions of the evidence were written for\neach theme that the authors determined in the above\nstages. All authors reviewed descriptions for clarity and\nrelevance and some themes were combined post hoc to\nimprove readability and avoid redundancy.\nMain text\nDirect efects on pregnancy\nDuring pregnancy, people undergo signifcant physiologic and immunologic alterations to support and protect the developing fetus.

Why did the spread of the coronavirus\nbring the global economy to its knees? The answer lies in two methods by which coronavirus\nstifled economic activities. First, the spread of the virus encouraged social distancing which led to\nthe shutdown of financial markets, corporate offices, businesses and events. Second, the\nexponential rate at which the virus was spreading, and the heightened uncertainty about how bad\nthe situation could get, led to flight to safety in consumption and investment among consumers,\ninvestors and international trade partners. We focus on the period from the start of 2020 through\nMarch when the coronavirus began spreading into other countries and markets. We draw on realworld observations in assessing the restrictive measures, monetary policy measures, fiscal policy\nmeasures and the public health measures that were adopted during the period. We empirically\nexamine the impact of social distancing policies on economic activities and stock market indices.\nThe findings reveal that the increasing number of lockdown days, monetary policy decisions and\ninternational travel restrictions severely affected the level of economic activities and the closing,\nopening, lowest and highest stock price of major stock market indices. In contrast, the imposed\nrestriction on internal movement and higher fiscal policy spending had a positive impact on the\nlevel of economic activities, although the increasing number of confirmed coronavirus cases did\nnot have a significant effect on the level of economic activities.\nJEL classification: G21, G28, I11, I18\nKeywords: Covid-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, outbreak, social distancing, pandemic,\nfinancial crisis, global recession, public health, spillovers, monetary policy, fiscal policy, liquidity\nprovision, Central banks.\nApril, 2020\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Introduction\nIn 2019, there was anxiety about the impact of a US-China trade war, the US presidential elections\nand Brexit on the World Economy. On account of these, the IMF had predicted moderated global\ngrowth of 3.4 percent. But COVID-19 – the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel strain of\ncoronavirus from the SARS species – changed the outlook unexpectedly. Due to fear and\nuncertainty, and to rational assessment that firms’ profits are likely to be lower due to the impact\nof COVID-19, global stock markets erased about US$6 trillion in wealth in one week from 24th\nto 28th of February. The S&P 500 index lost over $5 trillion in value in the same week in the US\nwhile the S&P 500’s largest 10 companies experienced a combined loss of over $1.4 trillion,1\nalthough some of these were recovered in the subsequent week. Some of the loss in value was due\nto rational assessment by investors that firms’ profits would decline due to the impact of the\ncoronavirus.\nThe International Air Transportation Association (IATA) stated that the air travel industry would\nlose US$113 billion if the COVID-19 outbreak was not quickly contained2\n. The IMF downgraded\nits growth projection for the global economy as the COVID-19 outbreak threw its earlier projection\ninto serious doubt. The tourism industry was affected as the travel opportunities for Chinese\ntourists, who usually spend billions annually, were severely curtailed. There were increased flight\ncancellations, cancelled hotel bookings and cancelled local and international events worth over\n$200billion. The flow of goods through global supply chains vastly reduced significantly given\nthat China was the world’s largest manufacturer and exporter, and the Chinese government ordered\nthe closure of major factories in the country. Countries like Iran, Italy and France issued stay-athome nationwide policies to control the spread of the virus, which had already caused multiple\ndeaths and was putting pressure on the national public healthcare infrastructure. Such stay-at-home\npolicies planted the seeds of recession in developed countries, and there was a general consensus\namong economists that the coronavirus pandemic would plunged the world into a global recession\n(Financial Times, 2020).\n3 The International Monetary Fund in March stated that it expected a\n\n1 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-stocks-carnage/coronavirus-then-oil-collapse-erase-5-\ntrillion-from-u-s-stocks-idUSKBN20W2TJ\n2\nIATA: https://airlines.iata.org/news/potential-for-revenue-losses-of-113bn-due-to-covid-19-\n%E2%80%9Ccrisis%E2%80%9D\n3\nFinancial Times: Global recession already here, say top economists. https://www.ft.com/content/be732afe-6526-\n11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

(Georgieva, 2020)4\n.\nThe literature on the cause of recessions is vast (see Jagannathan et al, 2013; Stiglitz, 2010; Gaiotti,\n2013; Bezemer, 2011; Mian and Sufi, 2010; Bentolila et al, 2018; Bagliano and Morana, 2012).\nBut the cause of the 2020 global recession was novel in modern history. The coronavirus triggered\na new type of recession that was different from the past triggers of a recession. For instance, the\nAsian debt crisis of 1997 was caused by the collapse of the Thai baht in July 1997, which created\npanic that caused a region-wide financial crisis and economic recession in Asia (Radelet and Sachs,\n1998). The 2008 global financial crisis, which translated to a recession, was caused by loose\nmonetary policy which created a bubble, followed by subprime mortgages, weak regulatory\nstructures, and high leverage in the banking sector (Allen and Carletti, 2010). The 2016 recession\nin Nigeria was caused by the fall in the price of crude oil, balance of payment deficit, adoption of\na fixed-float exchange rate regime, an increase in the pump price of petrol, activities of pipeline\nvandals and infrastructure weaknesses. The 2010 recession in Greece was caused by the aftereffect of the global financial crisis, structural weaknesses in the Greek economy, and lack of\nmonetary policy flexibility as a member of the Eurozone (Rady, 2012).\nIn this paper, we show how the coronavirus outbreak led to spillovers into major sectors of the\nglobal economy, and how fast policy response by several governments either triggered and\nprolonged the recession while trying to save the lives of citizens. We also investigate the effect of\nsocial distancing policies on the level of economic activities and stock index prices.\nThe discussion in this paper contributes to the financial crisis literature (Allen and Carletti, 2010;\nJagannathan et al, 2013; Mian and Sufi, 2010; Stiglitz, 2010; Ozili, 2020). This paper contributes\nto the literature by showing that non-financial factors and/or non-economic factors can trigger both\na financial and economic meltdown in unprecedented ways. The implication for financial stability\nis that future stress testing of the resilience of the financial system should take into account human\nhealth factors as an important element in their stress testing exercises.\n\n4\nFortune: https://fortune.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-economic-impact-predictions-great-recession-2020-\nmarkets-imf/\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Global Spillover\nInitially, the perception was that the COVID-19 pandemic would be localized in China only. It\nlater spread across the world through the movement of people. The economic pain became severe\nas people were asked to stay at home, and the severity was felt in various sectors of the economy\nwith travel bans affecting the aviation industry, sporting event cancellations affecting the sports\nindustry, the prohibition of mass gatherings affecting the events and entertainment industries\n(Horowit, 2020; Elliot, 2020).\nThere are parallels between the COVID-19 crisis and the events of 2007-2008: as in 2020, many\npeople in the earlier recession assumed the impacts would largely be localized (in that case based\non an assumption that the subprime mortgage crisis would be a relatively minor problem affecting\nonly the US, but ultimately affecting the global financial system) (Elliot, 2020). The sudden\neconomic disruption caused by COVID-19 is not only destructive but also has spillover\nimplications because it created demand and supply shocks in almost every area of human endeavor\n(El-Erian, 2020)7\n\n6 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200325-sitrep-65-covid19.pdf?sfvrsn=ce13061b_2\n7\nForeign Affairs: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2020-03-17/coming-coronavirus-recession\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Spillover to the travel industry\nThe coronavirus outbreak led the governments of many countries to impose restrictions on nonessential travel to countries affected by COVID-19, indefinitely suspending tourism travel, work\nvisas and immigrant visas. Some countries placed a complete travel ban on all forms of inward or\noutward travel, shutting down all airports in the country. At the height of the coronavirus\npandemic, most airplanes flew almost empty due to mass passenger cancellations. The travel\nrestrictions imposed by governments subsequently led to the reduction in the demand for all forms\nof travel which forced some airlines to temporarily suspend operations such as Air Baltic, LOT\nPolish Airlines, La Compagnie, and Scandinavian Airlines. Such travel restrictions cost the\ntourism industry alone a loss of over $200 billion globally, excluding other loss of revenue for\ntourism travel, and were forecast to cost the aviation industry a total loss of $113billion according\nto IATA.\n8 US airlines sought a $50bn bailout fund for the US Airline industry alone.\n9 The GTBA\nreported that the business travel sector would lose $820 billion in revenue due to the coronavirus\npandemic.\n10\n2.2. Spillover to the hospitality industry\nRestaurant businesses have been affected during the pandemic mainly through the governmentannounced ‘stay-at-home policy’ and ‘social distancing’ movement restriction imposed by the\ngovernment in many countries. This led to rapid shutdowns in cities and states to control the spread\nof the coronavirus, which threw many restaurants and hotels across the country into sudden shock.\nHotels across the world witnessed booking cancellations worth billions of dollars, and the hotel\nindustry sought a $150bn bailout.11 Restaurant executives laid off staff as they shut down their\nbusinesses temporarily. Many customers stayed at home, preferring to eat cooked meals at home.\nSome restaurant executives criticized the government for imposing the stay-at-home and social\ndistancing policy which destroyed many small restaurants and pub businesses in small cities. They\nargued that governments’ announcement of stay-at home policies or social distancing policies was\n\n8 https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-03-05-01/\n9 https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-seek-up-to-50-billion-in-government-aid-amid-coronavirus-crisis11584378242\n10 https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/03/11/business/11reuters-health-coronavirus-business-travel.html\n11 https://www.axios.com/hotel-industry-150-billion-coronavirus-relief-34910e41-2402-4260-b4b9-\n8f5b738db664.html\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

The economic impact of the\npandemic on the hotel industry was more severe than the 9/11 and 2008 recessions combined.\n2.3. Spillover to the sports industry\nThe sports industry was severely affected during the coronavirus outbreak. In the football segment,\nmajor European football leagues in England and Scotland announced the immediate suspension of\nfootball matches for 6 weeks until 30th April. The Turkish super league was the last major\nEuropean league to suspend its matches. In Formula One, the Monaco Grand Prix was cancelled.\nThe Tokyo Summer Olympic and Paralympic games were also postponed. In the hockey segment,\nthe 2020 hockey games in England was postponed. England's FIH Pro League games scheduled\nfor 2nd to 3rd and 16th to 17th May were postponed. In rugby games, the Pro14 final scheduled\nfor 20th June at the Cardiff City Stadium was cancelled. The major league rugby (MLR) was\ncancelled for the remainder of the 2020 season. In the baseball segment, all major baseball league\nseason games were called off in Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Motorsport game in Portugal was\npostponed after the Portuguese government declared a state of emergency and suspended all\nsporting events in the country. In the snooker segment, the World snooker championship to be held\nin Sheffield from 18th April to 4th May, was postponed. In the swimming segment, the 2020\nEuropean Aquatics Championship scheduled for 11th to 24th in Hungary was postponed until\nAugust. In the golf segment, the LPGA tour was rescheduled for 10th to 13th September 2020.\nThe resulting loss in revenue to the sponsors and organizers of the cancelled games ran into billions\nof dollars.\n\n12 https://thebristolcable.org/2020/03/bristol-coronavirus-businesses-impact-food-restaurants-pubs-governmentthrew-us-under-bus/\n13 According to the American Hotel and Lodging Association.\nhttps://www.ahla.com/covid-19s-impact-hotel-industry\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

The oil price war: a contributing factor\nEarly in 2020, the price of oil fell due to the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. The\ncoronavirus pandemic worsened the situation through the reduction in the demand for oil. The\nimposed travel restrictions during the pandemic, which led to a reduction in the movement of\npeople and goods, resulted in a fall in demand for aviation fuel, coal and other energy products,\nwhich subsequently led to a fall in oil price due to low demand. The coronavirus crisis also affected\na wide range of energy markets such as the coal, gas and renewable energy markets, but its impact\non oil markets was more severe because it stopped the movement of people and goods, which led\nto a drastic decline in the demand for transport fuels. When Saudi Arabia later supplied excess oil\nto the world, the market was flooded with too much oil, exceeding demand during the COVID-19\npandemic, and subsequently leading to a fall in oil price.\n2.4.2. Loss of oil revenue to oil-dependent countries\nThe effect of the pandemic on oil-dependent countries was severe. The global decline in oil price\ncombined with the low demand for oil products in the international market led to a significant\nshortfall in oil revenue to oil-dependent countries, which increased current account deficits and\nworsened the balance of payment position of many oil-dependent countries such as Venezuela,\nAngola and Nigeria. These countries also faced increasing pressure on their foreign exchange\nreserves, which subsequently led to the devaluation of local currencies against the dollar. Countries\nlike Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa experienced a reduction in the price of petrol in the local gas\nstations. National budgets were also affected. The sustained decline in global oil price due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic meant that the current national budget became outdated for most oildependent countries, and had to be revised because it did not reflect the current economic reality\nsince the budget was priced at a higher oil price from 2019. Consequently, the national budget of\nsome oil-dependent countries ran into massive deficits which forced some countries to either (i)\nseek foreign loan from the IMF, World Bank and other lenders to fund their budget deficits, or (ii)\ncreate a new budget that was priced using the current low oil price in the global market.\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Spillover to import-dependent countries\nMany import-dependent countries were severely affected during the coronavirus pandemic. Many\ncountries imported their essential commodities from major exporting countries like China, India\nand Japan, and depend largely on these countries for the consumption of essential commodities.\nThe reduction in goods flowing through the global supply chain, and substantial reliance on China\nfor imported goods, led to shortages of supplies to import-dependent countries as China shut down\nmany of its export factories. This led to increases in the price of the remaining stock of imported\nsupplies already in import-dependent country, which also triggered inflationary pressures on the\nprice of basic commodities despite the general low demand for imports due to the coronavirus\npandemic. It was difficult to find alternative imports after China’s shut-down because many\ncountries had partially or fully closed their borders which stifled international trade at the time.\n2.6. Spillover to the financial sector: Banks and Fintech\nThe macroeconomic slowdown led to a rise in nonperforming loans in the banking sector by 250\nbasis points. Private sector banks had the highest exposure to credit risk during the outbreak.\n14\nNonperforming loans arose from loans issued to small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs),\nairlines, hotels, tour operators, restaurants, retail, construction and real estate businesses. During\nthe pandemic, there was a general decline in the volume of bank transactions, a decline in card\npayments and a fall in the use of ATM cash machines worldwide. This led to fewer fees collected\nby banks which negatively affected banks’ profit. FinTech businesses were also affected. Some\nFinTech businesses witnessed very low patronage by consumers leading to loss of revenue and\nprofits, which negatively affected the equity investment of venture capitalists that funded existing\nand new FinTech firms. This made many venture capitalists begin to hoard new equity which led\nto the drying up of financing for some FinTech businesses. On the other hand, the lockdowns due\nto the coronavirus outbreak resulted in higher demand for some sorts of online services such as\nonline shopping.\n\n14 https://www.ft.com/content/153f2922-6e15-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Spillover to financial markets\nThe most visible outcome of the COVID-19 crisis on financial markets was the effect in the global\nstock market. Global stock markets lost $6 trillion in value over six days from 23 to 28 February,\naccording to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Between February 20 and March 19, the S&P 500 index fell\nby 28% (from 3,373 to 2,409), the FTSE 250 index fell by 41.3% (from 21,866 to 12,830), and the\nNikkei fell by 29% (from 23,479 to 16,552). In the same period, large international banks\nwitnessed a plunge in their share price, for example, Citigroup’s share price fell by 49% (from\nUS$78.22 to US$39.64), JP Morgan Chase’s share price fell by 38% (from US$137.49 to\nUS$85.30), and Barclays’ share price fell by 52% (from £181.32 to £86.45). Although the oil price\nwar, in which Russia and Saudi Arabia were driving down oil price by increasing oil production,\nplayed a role in the fall in stock markets indices, the subsequent fall in stock market indices in\nMarch was mainly due to investors’ flight to safety during the coronavirus pandemic.\n2.8. Spillover to the event industry\nPrior to 2020, the event sector contributed significantly to the economy. In 2018, for instance,\nbusiness events hosted more than 1.5 billion participants across more than 180 countries (Oxford\nEconomics)15. The events industry generated more than $1.07 trillion of direct spending,\nrepresenting spending to plan business events, produce business events, business events-related\ntravel, and direct spending by exhibitors. The industry also created 10.3 million direct jobs globally\nand generated $621.4 billion of direct GDP.16\nDuring the coronavirus outbreak, the events industry was hit financially by a large number of\ncancellations — exhibitions, live music shows, conference, weddings, parties, corporate events,\nbrand launches, trade shows, and more. Several big events were cancelled, for instance, the E3 and\nSXSW tech events were cancelled which led to direct losses beyond $1 billion. Informa delayed\nor cancelled events worth £400m over coronavirus pandemic. The 2020 Met Gala was postponed\nindefinitely. In the US, many big event management companies that were hit financially by the\ncoronavirus outbreak appealed for federal aid from the U.S. government. The event ticketing\nsegment of the industry was also affected. One of the biggest global ticketing and events\n\n15 https://insights.eventscouncil.org/Portals/0/OEEIC%20Global%20Meetings%20Significance%20%28FINAL%29%202018-11-09-2018.pdf\n16 https://eventscouncil.org/coronavirus\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3562570\nPreprint not peer reviewed\nOzili and Arun (2020)\n11\ncompany ‘Eventbrite’ announced that the COVID-19 outbreak materially affected its business\noutlook for 2020. The effect of the increasing cancellation on Eventbrite was so bad that the company\nhad to withdraw its previously published ‘positive outlook’ for the first quarter of 2020. The effect\nof the outbreak on global live events was worsened by the social distancing policy imposed by\nseveral governments.\n2.9. Spillover to the entertainment industry\nThe global film industry incurred a $5 billion loss during the coronavirus outbreak. Several\nHollywood movie productions were postponed indefinitely which meant goodbye to theatre and\ncinema. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) reported that an\nestimated 120,000 below-the-line entertainment industry jobs were lost due to the coronavirus\npandemic, most of which were theatrical stage employees. The pandemic shutdown resulted in the\nloss of 120,000 jobs held by its 150,000 members, and the IATSE advocated that the entertainment\nindustry should be included in the planned federal stimulus (or bailout) package. In Italy, the\nCOVID-19 outbreak severely affected the entertainment industry which incurred losses estimated\nto run into the millions of euros per week: from February 23 to March 1, 2020. There were\nestimated losses of 7.3million euros in the film screening sector, 7.2million euros in the theater\nsegment, 4.1million euros in the live music segment, 2.5 million euros in the dance activities\nsegment and 1.8 million euros in the exhibition segment.17 In the UK18\n, an estimated 50,000\nindustry freelancers were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\naccording to BECTU (Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union).\nCollectively, unemployment levels in the entertainment industry rose to unprecedented highs, and\nyet there were doubts as to whether the entertainment industry would receive part of the planned\nfederal stimulus package as many lawmakers argued that the entertainment industry was not a\nmain driver of the economy, and some argued that the entertainment industry does not contribute\nmuch to economic activities compared to the financial and manufacturing sectors.\n\n17 https://www.statista.com/statistics/1103010/impact-of-coronavirus-covid-19-on-the-entertainment-industry-initaly/\n18 https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/19/loss-of-jobs-income-film-industry-hollywood-coronaviruspandemic-covid-19\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3562570\nPreprint not peer reviewed\nOzili and Arun (2020)\n12\n2.10. Spillover to the health sector\nIn many countries, the services of public hospitals grew in high demand but the majority of the\ntesting equipment were in private hospitals. China temporarily closed all hospitals in the central\ncity of Wuhan, the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak. Iran's hospitals struggled to cope with the\ncoronavirus outbreak. In Spain, the Spanish government nationalized all private hospitals and\nhealthcare providers as the virus was spreading very rapidly. Singapore had sufficient healthcare\nfacilities and workers to cope with the growing number of COVID-19 patients,19 and private\nhospitals were inviting and accepting foreign COVID-19 patients. The Ministry of Health (MOH)\nin Singapore subsequently advised all doctors in public and private hospitals, and private specialist\nclinics, to immediately stop accepting new foreign patients who do not live in Singapore.\nThe coronavirus outbreak also affected the pharmaceutical supply chain. Drug makers around the\nworld relied heavily on ingredients made in Chinese factories. About 60% of the world’s active\npharmaceutical ingredients (API) were made in China before the coronavirus outbreak, and the\ncoronavirus outbreak caused severe supply problems as China shutdown majority of its factories\nincluding factories that produce drugs. Many pharmaceutical companies did not store up\nsubstantial amounts of APIs prior to the coronavirus outbreak, and as a result, some essential drugs\nwere in short supply. The pharmaceutical companies that had stored up a substantial amount of\nAPIs in their warehouse refused to sell them for fear of running out of supplies while others were\nwilling to sell only at a very high price. The overreliance on Chinese API manufacturers posed the\nbiggest risk to the global pharmaceutical industry and the COVID-19 outbreak amplified the risk\neven further.\nHealth insurers were also affected. Many health insurers in the US could not cope with the\ninsurance payments to hospitals and the insurers sought to be included in the planned federal relief\nstimulus package as the health sector’s economic outlook was negative. The S&P 500 Managed\nHealth Care index fell to 7% in February indicating that investors felt the health care sector would\nbe severely hit. Moody's rating agency downgraded the nonprofit and public healthcare sector's\noutlook from stable to negative because of the continued spread of the coronavirus disease\n(COVID-19). Moody’s reported that the health sector was likely to see fewer cash flow in 2020\n\n19 https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-has-sufficient-healthcare-facilities\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3562570\nPreprint not peer reviewed\nOzili and Arun (2020)\n13\ncompared to 2019 and falling revenue due to the cancellation of elective surgeries. The ratings\nagency also stated that even if the coronavirus outbreak could be contained, nonprofit healthcare\ncompanies were already facing rising expenses and widespread uncertainty. Also, investment\nbankers that invested heavily in health care pressured health care companies and medical supply\nfirms to consider ways through which they can profit from the crisis by increasing prices. The\neffect of the outbreak on the health sector was the increase in the number of deaths due to the\nshort supply of drugs, lack of vaccine to cure the patients, insufficient number of hospital beds\nand insufficient isolation centers to cater for the rising number of COVID-19 cases.\n2.11. Spillover to the education sector\nThe coronavirus disrupted the $600 billion higher education industry.\n20 Educators and students\naround the world felt the ripple effect of the coronavirus as colleges and universities were\ninstructed to shut down after the coronavirus was declared a public health emergency in many\ncountries. There were school closures of some kind in 44 countries on four continents, including\nAfrica, with hundreds of millions of students around the world facing disruptions. The outbreak\nhad a more severe consequence on schools that did not have an online learning platform. Moody’s,\na credit rating agency, downgraded the U.S. higher education outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘negative’,\nbecause 30% of the colleges and universities in the US already had a weak operating performance,\nand it was difficult for these colleges and universities to adapt with the financial and academic\nchanges required to cope with the coronavirus outbreak. Also, UNESCO reported that the COVID19 outbreak disrupted the education of at least 290.5 million students worldwide.21 Public schools\nin the US were closed, Australia shut down some schools, while countries like Israel, Nigeria,\nEgypt, Italy, France, and Spain shut down all schools, and this created some form of\nunemployment for teachers. Northern Ireland’s government suspended all examinations in its\ncolleges and universities. Multiple U.S. based universities that ran a study abroad program\noverseas instructed students to return home from Italy, France and Spain as the coronavirus\noutbreak became severe in those countries. On the positive side, there were suggestions that the\ncoronavirus outbreak increased the importance of online education and distance learning, but the\nreality was that only a small percentage of the wor",

While Covid‐19 continues to spread at an alarming rate of contamination, governments are easing restrictions and gradually lifting lockdowns in many countries. At the beginning of the evolution of the pandemic, most countries in the world adopted some measures in response to the Covid‐19 pandemic. After a few months of implementation, the global economy began to suffer and the government authorities decided to relax the restricting measures in order to revitalize corresponding economies. For example, some Heads of States such as Donald Trump or Jair Bolsonaro have had some disagreements with their administrations or a large part of citizens in their countries. They are criticized for putting the economy ahead of people's lives. The leaders are therefore faced to a veritable equation: limiting the pandemic under the constraint of boosting economic activity.\n\nThe extant literature has: (a) attempted to find relationships between government measures against the Covid‐19 pandemic and their effectiveness and (b) searched for a link between the scale of these measures and the corresponding economic impact (Agbe, 2020; Bisong, Ahirwal, & Jorge, 2020; Price & van Holm, 2020; Farayabi & Asongu, 2020; Oily, 2020). A common shortcoming in the underlying literature is that it has failed to assess the geography on the effectiveness and consequences of Covid‐19 measures with particular emphasis on various regions of the world. In order to address the attendant gap in the literature, the objective of this paper is threefold; firstly, we analyze the economic impact of the pandemic. Secondly, we evaluate the effectiveness and relevance of different Covid‐19 measures across regions. Finally, we look at the correlation between these measures and the economic outcomes.\n\nThe positioning of the study departs from the recent strand of Coronavirus‐centric literature that has focused on, inter alia: the socio‐economic effects of the novel virus (Nicola et al., 2020); policy and scholarly insights into the economic consequences of the Covid‐19 pandemic (Ataguba, 2020); opportunities, socio‐economic incidences and policy measures linked to the novel virus; (Ozili, 2020); the impact of the pandemic on remittances flows (Bisong et al., 2020); the effect of the pandemic on childhood poverty in North Africa and the Middle East (Agbe, 2020); mathematical modeling of infectious viral diseases (Adekola, Adekunle, Egberongbe, Onitilo, & Abdullahi, 2020); nexuses between the Covid‐19 pandemic, inequality and social stratification (Obeng‐Odoom, 2020) and assessing laboratory responses to the coronavirus (Odeyemi et al., 2020). While the extant studies have examined the effect of the Covid‐19 pandemic, the attendant literature is sparse on a comprehensive study that provides a comparative assessment of the consequences and effectiveness of Covid‐19 measures at the global level. The purpose of this study is therefore to fill the gap in the light of the objectives discussed above.\n\nThe rest of the study is structured as follows. The data and research methods are covered in Section 2. Section 3 presents the results and corresponding discussion while Section 4 concludes with policy implications and future research directions.\n\n2 DATA PRESENTATION AND METHODS\nIn this paper, three types of data are used. The first are government measures applied in response to the Covid‐19 pandemic. The second are health data on the evolution of positive new cases. Finally, the third are macroeconomic projections and updates on gross domestic product (GDP) growth due to the coronavirus. Data of different measures are from the Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) Government Measures Dataset. This dataset is part of the Covid‐19 pandemic and puts together all the measures implemented by governments worldwide in response to the underlying pandemic. It includes secondary data review collected by ACAPS analysts and volunteers from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Lund. The data are divided into five categories (social distancing, movement restrictions, public health measures, governance and socio‐economic measures and lockdowns). Each category is broken down into several types of measures as shown in Table 1. The dataset is updated once a week and our data are as of June 18, 2020. To capture only the decision aimed at breaking the chain of transmission of the virus, we use only the measures being introduced or expanded.\n\nTABLE 1. Measures' descriptions\nMeasures\tDescriptions\nMovement restrictions\nAdditional health or other document requirements upon arrival\tAuthorities upon arrival to a country may request a health declaration format or doctor's certifications to allow entry.\nBorder checks\tAuthorities may travel and identification document checks in land and sea entry points in a country.\nBorder closure\tA country may close the land or sea border with the neighboring countries. Only nationals and residents are allowed through.\nComplete border closure\tA country has completely closed the borders for all ‐ including nationals.\nCheckpoints within the country\tAuthorities may have installed check points within the country on regional borders or main road to a) conduct health checks and b) stop the internal movement of people.\nInternational flights suspension\tInternational and/or internal flights may be suspended by government authorities.\nDomestic travel restrictions\tAuthorities are limiting the movement of people within a country.\nVisa restrictions\tAuthorities are limiting specific nationalities from entering the country or they are adding visa restrictions that did not exist before.\nCurfews\tIntroducing curfews in some regions or in the whole country.\nSurveillance and monitoring\tAuthorities may conduct electronic surveillance via mobile phones or other ways to do case tracing or to monitor the movement of people.\nPublic health measures\nAwareness campaigns\tAuthorities are conducting awareness campaigns on media, social media, public spaces, or elsewhere around hygiene methods, social distancing, of other measures.\nIntroduction of isolation and quarantine policies\t(a) People have to self‐quarantine or to be put in isolation units upon arrival to a country. (b) People with symptoms have to self‐quarantine or to be put in isolation units. (c) People who have been in touch with confirmed Covid‐19 cases have to self‐ quarantine.\nGeneral recommendations\tThe government has made general recommendations to people to be careful or given some general hygiene guidelines. This usually implies a weak response where other measures are not really taken.\nHealth screenings in airports and border crossings\tHealth screening and body temperature controls are conducted by authorities in airports and border crossings.\nObligatory medical tests not related to Covid‐19\tThere are reports of governments having forced people to take health checks for conditions not related to Covid‐19 (such as HIV).\nPsychological assistance and medical social work\tAuthorities have implemented measures for the psychological assistance of the patients, their families, as well as people in quarantine or lockdown.\nMass population testing\tAuthorities are screening all the population of a country or of a region within a country.\nStrengthening the public health system\tAuthorities put in place measures to strengthen the health system. These could be: (a) Hiring more doctors or other medical personnel. (b) Building new hospitals and medical centers or expanding current ones. (c) Other\nTesting policy\tConducting tests to identify infected people.\nRequirement to wear protective gear in public\tMasks/gloves and so forth when required by law.\nOther public health measures enforced\tI.E. sanitation of transports, additional health regulations not falling under other categories\nAmendments to funeral and burial regulations\tChanges in burial regulation for example in order to limit the number of people who can attend or change the way the burial is conducted.\nGovernance and socio‐economic measures\nEconomic measures\tAuthorities have taken economic measures in order to mitigate the impact of the other restrictions to the economy and the society.\nEmergency administrative structures activated or established\tAuthorities have put in place emergency administrative structures such as emergency response committees and so forth in order to coordinate the response and/or decide on measures and/or monitor the implementation.\nLimit product imports/exports\tAuthorities are limiting the import or export of either food or health items.\nState of emergency declared\tAuthorities have declared a state of emergency. Usually this measure is used to be able to implement other measures that are not allowed by constitutions in a regular situation. This may also include state of necessity, exceptional state, state of public health emergency.\nMilitary deployment\tThe military has been deployed to support the medical operations and ensure compliance with the measures.\nLimit public gatherings\tCancelation of public events. Limit to the number of people that can meet in public and private spaces.\nClosures of businesses and public services\tBusinesses, public services and facilities are closing access to the public. In some countries, services are available online.\nChanges in prison policies\tChange in policies around prisons to mitigate the spread of the disease. This may include early release but also suspension of day‐release programs, suspension of visits and so forth.\nSchools closure\tAuthorities have closed schools.\nLockdown\nPartial lockdown\tPartial lockdown includes: (a) The population cannot leave their houses apart for specific reasons that they have to communicate to the authorities. (b) All stores that are not related to food supplyor pharmacies are not open.\nFull lockdown\tFull lockdown includes: (a) The population cannot leave their houses apart for specific reasons that they have to communicate to the authorities. (b) All non‐essential services closed and production stops.\nLockdown of refugee/IDP camps or other minorities\tLimitations to the population living in camps and/or camp like conditions.\nSource: ACAPS.\nRegarding the evolution of the health situation, we use the data on the geographic distribution of Covid‐19 confirmed new cases worldwide as of June 26, 2020 available at the European Union Open Data Portal.1 The dataset also provides numbers of daily deaths due to Covid‐19 over time. To assess the situation of the pandemic in the country, we refer to the existence of a possible peak. Our approach is as follows. Firstly, we plot the evolution curve of new cases, which is a daily frequency time series. Secondly, we evaluate the trend of the curve. If it is on a downward trend or seems to have peaked, we judge that the situation is improving. Otherwise, we assume that the situation is deteriorating further in that country.\n\nConcerning the economic information, we employ the pre‐“Covid‐19” macroeconomic projections of October 2019 and revised macroeconomic projections of April 2020. Following Diop and Asongu (2020), we estimate the macroeconomic impact by the difference between these two projections. The result will be an economic contraction caused by the Coronavirus everything else remaining equal. It should be noted however that, the downward revisions have also been the consequences of idiosyncratic factors (such as structural constraints in South Africa), policy adjustments in Ethiopia and natural shocks and other climate incidences (such as the locust invasion in Eastern Africa) (International Monetary Fund, 2020). Once we have all information about health evolution, government measures in response to the Covid‐19 pandemic and projected macroeconomic outcomes, we can now evaluate their relationships. As for the methodology, we employ a statistical toolbox such as descriptive statistics to analyze the macroeconomic impact and peaks. Indeed, we use the comparison of means (t‐test) to determine whether the means of the group of countries that reached a peak in the evolution of the pandemic and the group of countries where the situation has not improved, are equal with respect to the different government measures. Lastly, we analyze the correlation between the economic outcomes and government measures in response to Covid‐19 by displaying scatterplots.\n\n3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we present different results obtained. Table 2 reports the summary statistics of the macroeconomic impact of Covid‐19 by regions consisting of 186 countries. The impact estimated corresponds to an economic contraction expressed in percentage points of low GDP. The pandemic has had a severe impact on global growth based on the World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast. Overall, the global growth would leave 2020 GDP some 7.12 percentage points lower than in the pre‐Coronavirus projections. Libya is expected to be the country most affected by this shock (impact of 58.70 percentage points) while Equatorial Guinea earns the lowest impact (0.5 percentage points). When we compare the impact by region, it is worthwhile to note that the Asia‐Pacific and Middle East bloc exhibits the lowest economic impact (5.97 percentage points). It is followed by Africa (6.32 percentage points). We can note that of Libya is very extreme. Apart from Libya, the most impacted country is Seychelles with a contraction of 14.1 percentage points of GDP growth. Europe and the Americas are the most affected regions by the Covid‐19 pandemic (8.69 percentage points and 8.27 percentage points, respectively).\n\nTABLE 2.

Overall, as of the 26th of June 2020, of 170 countries, only 62 had reached the peak of the pandemic, corresponding to 36.59%. This result confirms the pessimism of the WHO authorities on the Covid‐19 pandemic. According to the WHO authorities, 60% of the world's 10 million Covid‐19 confirmed cases since December 2019 were registered in the month of June. This situation indicates that the pandemic is getting worse and not slowing down. This concern is much more pronounced in African countries and the American continent. For example, in Africa, only seven countries out of 54 have reached the peak of the pandemic (i.e., 12.96%). Recently, the WHO alerted the international community on the situation of the Covid‐19 pandemic in Africa. In effect, it is spreading at an alarming rate in Africa especially in rural areas. It should be noted that so far, Africa has been one of the safest continents. However, the confirmed new cases and deaths in these current weeks show that there is cause for concern. The positive result emerging from this table is the case of Europe. In this region, 32 countries out of 43 (i.e., 74.42%) have reached the peak, implying that the situation of the pandemic is improving overall. The countries that were most affected by the pandemic such as Italy, Spain, and France have already reached the peak even if the fear of a second wave of infection is still present in Portugal and Germany.\n\nTABLE 3.

As detailed in the previous section, we estimate the improvement of the health situation by the observation of the peak. To this end, we use a binary codification (1 if the peak is reached and 0, otherwise). Here we use comparison of means test (t‐test).

When we consider the total government measures in response to the pandemic in the world as a whole, the p‐value is lower than .05, supporting the alternative hypothesis that the difference in means is not equal to 0; thus further indicating that there is a statistical difference between the two means. More specifically, the result confirms the position that the number of measures adopted by countries, in which the Covid‐19 pandemic already peaked, is statistically different from the number of measures adopted by the other group of countries. Since the difference is negative, the number of total measures in countries which have reached the peak is lower than those in countries which have not reached a peak yet. This difference in the number of measures and corresponding peak levels could be interpreted in the perspective that, at a global level, government measures have had a positive impact on the evolution of the pandemic. Contrarily, if we observe the result by region, it is apparent that only European countries have favorably benefited from these measures. If we take only the measures relating to lockdown into consideration, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, implying that the difference of means is not significantly different from 0. Thus, the lockdown imposed have not had a significant impact in reducing the spread of the pandemic. Regarding the restriction of movement, the null hypothesis is rejected in America contrarily to other regions. Hence, this restriction has only had an impact in America. Africa and Europe have contradictory outcomes for the social distancing measure. The measure has an expected outcome in Europe. Accordingly, social distancing measures are higher in countries with the peak than in the others and this difference is significant. However, in Africa, the situation is reversed. This surprising result implies that in Africa the enforcement of the social distancing measures is counter‐productive. For the governance and economic measures, the difference in the two means is only significant in Europe and when we consider the situation at the global level. In effect, the mean in the group of countries which reached the peak is twice as high as in the other group. Finally, the difference of the two means for the number of public health measures is not significant. On the face of it, this result seems to be surprising. However, it should be noted that most of the restrictions are awareness decisions or oriented toward people already infected.\n\nFinally, to depict the correlation between economic impact and government measures, we prefer the scatterplots with statistics of adjustment. The results are drawn on the Figures 1–4-1–4. Figure 1 provides a picture of the correlation between the economic impact of the Covid‐19 pandemic and the scale of the government measures applied to respond to the pandemic in Europe. No clear correlation patterns appear and the coefficient of determination is less than 10% for any of the measures. Indeed, a higher heterogeneity is noted and most of the countries display an important economic impact. Figure 2 shows the cross‐country correlations for Africa. What we observed in this graph is a higher concentration of the countries. The only outlier for all the measures is Libya. This country is severely affected economically by the Covid‐19 pandemic. Nigeria is also an outlier for lockdown measures. Contrarily to European countries in Figure 1, a higher homogeneity is observed. The same tendency of homogeneity is apparent in Figure 3 for the countries in American continent. Guyana is the main outlier given that the outlier of the USA is obvious by a high number of public health and governance and socio‐economic decisions. The coefficient of determination for the nexuses in Figure 3 is also low. Finally, in Figure 4 no clear correlation patterns are noted for the Asia‐Pacific and Middle East bloc. For a wide range of countries, the economic impact is important while the number of government measures is fairly low.\n\nimage\nFIGURE 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nCorrelation between economic impact and measures (Europe)\nimage\nFIGURE 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nCorrelation between economic impact and measures (Africa)\nimage\nFIGURE 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nCorrelation between economic impact and measures (America)\nimage\nFIGURE 4\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nCorrelation between economic impact and measures (Asia‐pacific and Middle East)\n4 CONCLUDING IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\nThis study has: (a) analysed the economic impact of the Covid‐19 pandemic, (b) evaluated the effectiveness and relevance of different measures against the pandemic and (c) examined nexuses between the corresponding measures and economic impacts. The study uses a sample of 186 countries divided into four main regions, notably: Asia‐Pacific and the Middle East, Europe, Africa and America. Thirty four preventives and mitigating measures against the Covid‐19 pandemic are classified into five main categories: lockdown, movement restrictions, governance and economic, social distancing, and public health measures. The empirical evidence is based on comparative difference in means tests and correlation analyses. The findings show how the effectiveness and consequences of the Covid‐19 measures are different across regions.\n\nThe comparative findings which are self‐evident from the tables and figures have also been discussed in the light of best‐performing and worse‐performing countries. The main obvious policy implication in worse‐performing regions and countries is for them to leverage on the experience and success stories from their best‐performing counterparts at country and regional levels. Moreover, the findings in terms of regional tendencies are also relevant to policy makers with respect to orientations in aid‐allocation decisions, such that more foreign aid and investment in an effort to fight the pandemic should be oriented toward regions that have not yet reached an infection peak.\n\nIn adopting the relevant policies to fight the ongoing pandemic, the comparative insights from the findings in the study are worthwhile. Inter alia: (a) from a holistic perspective, only European countries have favorably benefited from the Covid‐19 measures; (b) lockdown measures at the global level have not been significant in reducing the pandemic; (c) the restriction of movement measure has been relevant in curbing the spread in the American continent; (d) the enforcement of the social distancing measures has been productive in Europe and counter‐productive in Africa; (e) governance and economic measures have exclusively been relevant in Europe and (f) overall public health measures have not had the desired outcomes in flattening the infection curve probably because most of the underlying measures are awareness decisions or oriented toward people already infected.\n\nFuture studies can leverage on data with more time series properties as time unfolds to assess how the established findings in the study are robust to further empirical scrutiny. Accordingly, it is only as time unfolds that the relevant data would be available from which corresponding empirical techniques can enable studies to establish causality instead of correlations as apparent in this study. In the meantime, based on the findings provided in this study, a less time‐contingent future research direction could be to assess why some regions and countries are failing to adopt effective measures and from the corresponding findings, provide/propose appropriate measures designed to reverse the tendencies in the worse–performing countries and regions.",

The common point of pandemics is their serious negative effects on the global economy. Considering the food supply chain, one of the most important sectors of the economy, it has been seen that COVID-19 has an impact on the whole process from the field to the consumer. In the light of recent challenges in food supply chain, there is now considerable concern about food production, processing, distribution, and demand. COVID-19 resulted in the movement restrictions of workers, changes in demand of consumers, closure of food production facilities, restricted food trade policies, and financial pressures in food supply chain. Therefore, governments should facilitate the movement of workers and agri-food products. In addition, small farmers or vulnerable people should be supported financially. Facilities should change the working conditions and maintain the health and safety of employees by altering safety measures. Food protectionist policies should be avoided to prevent an increase in food prices. In conclusion, each country must realize the severity of the situation and sometimes should tighten or loosen the measures according to the spread of the pandemic. The supply chain also should be flexible enough to respond to the challenges in the food supply chain. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the agriculture and food sector and to summarize the recommendations required to reduce and control the effect of the pandemic.\n\npandemic, COVID-19, agriculture, food, supply chain\nIssue Section: Reviews\nIntroduction\nAs the COVID-19 disease spread rapidly to six continents by the novel coronavirus SARS-nCoV-2, many countries around the world have declared state of health emergency. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the rapidly spreading disease as a pandemic and called on countries to plan preparatory and response actions in line with the Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (WHO, 2020a; Vasavada, 2020). WHO explained that a pandemic caused by a coronavirus has not been seen before, and this disease is the first pandemic caused by the coronavirus. COVID-19 is the fifth pandemic, following 1918 influenza virus (H1N1), 1957 influenza virus (H2N2), 1968 influenza virus (H3N2), and 2009 Pandemic flu (H1N1), that resulted in the human deaths of around 50 million, 1.5 million, 1 million, and 300 000, respectively (Liu et al., 2020). WHO indicated that this outbreak is not just a public health crisis, but it is a crisis that will touch every sector. Therefore, every sector and every individual should be involved in this struggle (WHO, 2020c). As of 5 August 2020, the number of cases per 1 million population is given for different regions as follows: 9 613.03 in Americas, 3 694.43 in Europe, 1 136.41 in South-East Asia, 2 167.25 in Eastern Mediterranean, 742.75 in Africa, and 176.36 in Western Pacific region. The global total of confirmed cases has reached to 17 528. 223 per 1 million population and 687.64 per 1 million population for corresponding deaths (WHO, 2020b).\n\nThe ‘Strategic preparedness and response plan’ by WHO includes the health measures that all countries had to prepare for and respond to this pandemic. This plan covers what we have learned about the virus so far and aims to transform this information into strategic action that can guide all national and international partners while developing national and regional operational plans. According to this plan, priority steps and actions are outlined in eight main topics:\n\nCoordination, planning, and monitoring at the country level;\n\nRisk communication and community participation;\n\nSurveillance, quick response teams, and case investigation;\n\nEntry points;\n\nNational laboratories;\n\nPrevention and control of infection;\n\nSituation management;\n\nOperational support and logistics (WHO, 2020a).\n\nThe implementation of these measures caused the closure of workplaces and educational institutions, and temporary restrictions in travels and social meetings. Flexible working from home and online meetings have become standard practices nowadays. However, people who work in the food industry do not have work from home option hence they need to keep their typical office routines (Nicola et al., 2020; FAO and WHO, 2020).\n\nAs a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis, response plans for food workers were developed to provide guidance for continuity of operations in the food processing facilities and manage coronavirus in the food industry. Especially meat and poultry processing industries can be defined as the critical infrastructure in food and agriculture. The plan includes a hierarchy of control requirements for cleaning, sanitation, disinfection of facilities, screening, and monitoring of workers for COVID-19, managing the sick employees and education programs for workers and supervisors to prevent the spread of coronavirus (CDC, 2020b).\n\nEvery industry in the world expects to see how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect the manufacturing industry, and the food industry is no different from other industries. However, the difference in the food industry from other industries is to produce products that are essential for daily life. Everybody knows that if one factory closes, a certain number of people who works at these factories have the potential to starve, but if processors and distributors are infected, all people are at risk (Staniforth, 2020). In addition, the food industry is a very important sector in regard to economy. However, food sector faces different sets of challenges compared with other sectors that are not critical for daily life such as tourism and aviation during a pandemic. Pandemic might lead to a US$113 billion loss in aviation and US$80 billion in tourism sector (IATA, 2020; UNTWO, 2020). Some food companies face various challenges due to a drop in income, whereas others are working hard to meet the growing demand of retailers. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, some difficult decisions had to be made, including temporarily shut down of the various businesses. The fact is that this pandemic clearly demonstrated different companies from different industries are closely connected to each other all over the world (Sebastian, 2020; Shahidi, 2020).\n\nA major concern shared by all food companies is preserving the employee’s health and the provision of sufficient workforce due to those who do not want to work because of sickness or coronavirus fear. It is very important to protect and maintain the health of people working in the food supply chain during this time of crisis (FAO and WHO, 2020). However, keeping the distribution chain alive by the supply management strategies is also important to meet the consumer demands (De Sousa Jabbour et al., 2020). Maintaining the flow of food and commodities throughout the supply chain should be ensured with the contribution of all stakeholders. Ensuring the confidence of consumers is also essential for food safety and security (FAO and WHO, 2020). At this time of crisis, food security is associated with consumers’ access to food rather than food availability (OECD, 2020b).\n\nConsumers generally do not think much about how the food on their tables is produced. However, concerns about food safety in the midst of the global pandemic have drawn attention to the enormous infrastructure and workforce responsible for creating a safe and reliable food supply worldwide. Especially at the beginning of this global crisis, consumer demand for food has increased and some store shelves have been temporarily emptied and resulted in excess purchases of essential products. However, despite this unprecedented demand, the food supply chain remained strong, since many supply chain actors, including farmers, producers, distributors, and retailers, have worked hard to renew shelves (Nicola et al., 2020; Watts, 2020).\n\nDespite the large scale of the pandemic, there is no report that COVID-19 has been transmitted through food consumption to date. Therefore, as stated by the European Food Safety Authority, there is no evidence that food poses a risk to public health in relation to COVID-19. However, after the latest infections have been seen in Xinfandi market due to salmon processing, it can be concluded that the risk of the virus that transmitted through foods is lower than the perceived risk. Considering the survival time of SARS-CoV-2 in different environments such as plastic, steel, or cardboard, it is possible that animal tissues (meat, fish, or poultry) might be a serious source for foodborne transmission. Hygiene controls by food business operators are designed to prevent contamination of food by any pathogen and will therefore aim to prevent contamination of foods by the virus responsible for COVID-19 too (Arellano, 2020; Dalton, 2020; EC, 2020; Pressman et al., 2020). It was reported that foods were not a source of spread of coronaviruses including MERS and SARS-CoV due to the acidic environments of the stomach (pH < 3.5) in previous outbreaks. However, some cooking and eating habits may lead to the reappearance of the coronavirus from animals to humans (Rizou et al., 2020).\n\nTo summarize, four major issues have been raised in the food industry and the food supply chain during the COVID-19 outbreak. Firstly, people tend to have follow a healthy diet for protecting themselves and their immune systems (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2020). Therefore, the demand for the functional foods which contain bioactive ingredients increased. Secondly, food safety has gained more attention to prevent the transmission of coronavirus among producers, retailers, and consumers. Thirdly, food security concerns have arisen because of the people on lockdown restrictions. Lastly, food sustainability problems have emerged in the era of pandemic (Galanakis, 2020).\n\nIn the light of recent challenges in food supply chain, there is now considerable concern about the food supply chain. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide information about the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in the food supply chain and to summarize the measures taken to minimize these effects. Formal and informal sources were used to obtain information about the food supply chain during COVID-19 outbreak. The contents which were not reviewed by news editor, journal/magazine editor, or scientific editor before they are published online were not used as a supplementary source of information. Most of the content was based on the well-known organizations such as Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Commission (EC), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Food Information Council (IFIC), International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), International Labour Organization (ILO), International Trade Centre (ITC), The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nEffects of pandemic on food supply chain\nThe Food supply chain can be divided into five stages, including agricultural production, postharvest handling, processing, distribution/retail/service, and consumption. Two systems are being used in the food supply chain regarding food quality and safety. The First one is based on regulations and laws that use mandatory standards which are inspected by state agencies. The Second one is relying on voluntary standards which are defined by market laws or international associations (Bendekovic et al., 2015). Safety measures to ensure the continuity of food flow in each stage can be grouped as food employee’s health issues, personal hygiene, using personal protective equipments such as helmets and glove, sanitization of surfaces and working environments, safe handling/preparation/delivery of food, and maintenance of social distance. Protective measures in the last stages of the food supply chain are critical since more people can be potentially affected as moved towards the last stages (Rizou et al., 2020).\n\nUnlike foot and mouth disease, bird flu, Escherichia coli (E. coli), or Listeria, the COVID-19 pandemic does not directly affect production, as it does not spread directly through livestock or agricultural products (FAO, 2020a). However, due to the pandemic, governments around the world have made significant restrictions in the transportation (land, water, and air transport) of goods, as well as in the migration of labour. Reports showed that using the trucks for food distribution was declined to 60% since the restrictions in France which was 30% before the pandemic (FAO, 2020j; Bakalis et al., 2020).\n\nIn developing and underdeveloped countries, temporary or seasonal employment is common, especially for planting, sorting, harvesting, processing, or transporting crops to markets. Therefore, the supply chain is significantly affected as a result of the absence of local or migrant workers due to sickness or travel restrictions imposed by lockdown. It also weakens not only production abilities for others, but also their own food safety, in cases where the disease directly affects their health or movement (FAO, 2020k). Especially, labour shortage due to COVID-19 crisis caused severe disruptions in some sectors such as livestock production, horticulture, planting, harvesting, and crop processing which are relatively labour intensive (Stephens et al., 2020). However, shortage of farmworkers was a major issue well before the COVID-19 outbreak, too (Richards and Rickard, 2020).\n\nDue to the fact that many skilled workers in the harvest could not access various countries because of the border controls, a call has been made to the unemployed persons to work in the fields in France. In Britain, ‘Pick for Britain’ campaign was aimed to find 70 000 British to work in the field and during the harvest (Nature Plants, 2020). However, due to the shortage of workforce as a result of illness and physical distance to be maintained during production, the crisis undermines the ability of farms and agricultural businesses to work. These conditions retarded the delivery of food and agricultural inputs and created problems in providing continuous food supply to markets (ILO, 2020). Although many manufacturers rely on their core inputs, most are more susceptible to disruptions, as they must obtain their requirements from domestic markets. Logistics barriers that disrupt food supply chains further weaken high-value goods due to their short shelf life (Shahidi, 2020; FAO, 2020j, FAO, 2020k).\n\nMost agricultural activities depend on the season and weather, and therefore, activities need to follow a fine-tuned schedule with flexibility so that immediate actions can be performed when needed. Since all processes and stages in a supply chain are strongly connected to each other, a slight delay or glitch can trigger a butterfly effect resulting in a big loss in the yield and output (FAO, 2020k). Actually, there are many reports that farmers were forced to destroy their products by burning or leaving them to spoil because of the restrictions. Dairy Farmers in America Co-operative consider 14 million litres of milk are being dumped every day due to interrupted supply chain. In England, chair of dairy farmers reported that approximately 5 million litres of milk are at risk in one week. Also, It was reported that tea plants were being lost because of the logistical challenges in India (BBC, 2020a). Therefore, maintaining logistical efficiency is a key factor for the food industry, especially in global crisis. The biggest issues in the food supply chain are obtaining raw materials from suppliers and ensuring the continuity of food flow from manufacturers to end users (Alonso et al., 2007).The problems are jeopardizing the ability of agricultural businesses to continue their business as usual, and may have negative effects on food quality, freshness, and food safety, and hinder access to markets and affordability (FAO, 2020k). As countries struggle with that pandemic, they must make every effort to move the gears of the food supply chains. The impact of pandemic problems on agricultural systems largely depends on the intensity and composition of agricultural inputs and varies depending on the product produced and the country. Capital-intensive techniques are usually used in high-income countries for agricultural production, whereas production is mostly labour dependent in low-income countries. Thus, the supply chain should be kept running with a particular focus on the basics of logistic challenges (FAO, 2020j).\n\nFood sector contains many diverse products such as meat, fruit, vegetable, dairy, ready-to-eat foods, and other edible products (Hueston and McLeod, 2012). However, the food and agriculture chain can be broadly classified into two categories regarding capital investment and labour. The First one can be defined as staple products such as wheat, corn, maize, soybeans, and oilseeds. The Second one contains high-value products such as fruit, vegetables, and fisheries. Staple products require large amounts of capital investments. Restriction between cities, provinces, regions, and countries has a negative impact on the distribution of staple products (FAO, 2020c). In contrast to staple products, a great deal of labour is required to obtain high-value products. However, time-sensitive nature of the agricultural operations (O’Brien et al., 2014) and needs for higher productivity over time might lead to the agricultural transformation which can be defined as technological advancement and up-skilling of the labour force (Jeon, 2011; Martin, 2016).\n\nThe challenges that have been driven by movement restriction (national or international border closures) and the changes in demand of consumers are important. Because of the restrictions, consumers cannot go to restaurants and they prepare their meals at home. In addition, consumers do not want to go to markets and supermarkets due to catching the COVID-19 at the stores (FAO, 2020g).\n\nThe supply chain affects not only producers, distributors, and consumers, but also food-processing plants that are labour intensive. Production was reduced, suspended, or temporarily discontinued in many plants due to the workers who were found to be COVID-19 positive and who were reluctant to go to work, thinking that they would get sick at work, mostly in meat-processing food companies at the time of the outbreak. For these reasons, it was thought that the production capacity of pork facilities decreased by approximately 25% in late April (Devereux et al., 2020; Flynn, 2020).\n\nIn this context, there were at least 462 meat packaging and 257 food-processing plants and 93 farm and production facilities were affected by COVID-19 cases in the USA. At least 54,036 workers (39,905 meat packaging workers, 8,343 food-processing workers, and 5,788 farmers) have been identified as COVID-19 positive and at least 232 workers (184 meat packaging workers, 34 food-processing workers, and 14 farm workers) have lost their lives (Douglas, 2020). In Brazil, 2,400 meat plant workers were identified as COVID-19 positive from 24 slaughterhouses in 18 municipalities. Several meat factories suspended their operations after 246 positive cases in England and Wales. In Gana, 534 staff tested positive for the virus at a fish-processing factory. In Germany, 1,553 cases of COVID-19 were found at meat-processing plants, and in France, more than 100 coronavirus infections were recorded at slaughterhouses (BBC, 2020b; Gulland, 2020; Kaur, 2020; Ziady et al., 2020). Close-down of the food plants created the ripple effect in food supply chain. Producers have been forced to cull the farm animals since they could not find any plant to sell their livestock. Greater consumer demand resulted in empty shelves and a decrease in supply caused an increase in the price of meat products. Some of the markets limited the number of items such as beef and pork products that a single customer could buy. Food services were also affected, and some restaurants stopped serving beef hamburgers (Hobbs, 2020; Levany, 2020; Murphy, 2020; Rude, 2020; Valinsky, 2020). Despite government reassurances, some of the stores started free delivery services on orders to prevent panic-buying. In addition, supermarkets determined the number of people allowed at any given time to stop overcrowding. Stores also adjusted special shopping hours for vulnerable customers (Nicola et al., 2020).\n\nThere are several reasons at play that make food-processing facilities potential hotbeds for outbreak. Keeping social distance inside the food plants is difficult because workers stand side by side during long shifts on production lines. In addition, talking loudly or shouting, due to noisy enivironments, results in the release of more droplets to the air (Stewart et al., 2020). Employees also travel on the same buses or use car-sharing systems allowing the virus to spread further. Moreover, the majority of workers have lower income and mostly do not have insurance coverage or paid sick leave. Therefore, food-processing workers are taking risk to go work even if they feel sick which increase the risk of infection. Cold and humid environment inside the food-processing facilities is another factor that facilitates the spread of the COVID-19. It is possible that cold and dark environments without any ultraviolet light can keep coronavirus alive and might result in an increase in the rates of transmission (Artiga and Rae, 2020; Gulland, 2020). The stability tests of the virus under five different temperatures (4, 22, 37, 56, and 70 °C) and five different surfaces (paper, tissue paper, wood, and cloth) showed that SARS-CoV-2 is highly stable at 4 °C, but sensitive to heat. In addition, it was found that the virus is stable on smooth surfaces, however susceptible to standard disinfectants (Chin et al., 2020). Another study by Van Doremalen et al. (2020) suggested that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable in aerosols for 3 h. The same study revealed that virus was viable for 4, 24, 48, and 72 h on copper, cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic, respectively. These outcomes indicated that the cooking temperatures above 70 °C are enough to kill the SARS-CoV-2, but sanitary recommendations (washing hands, separating raw and cooked meat, etc.) should be followed while preparing and storing the foods (Rizou et al., 2020; Shahidi, 2020).\n\nCentralized food manufacturing is another factor that caused disruption of food chains during COVID-19 outbreak. This paradigm helped the food processors to increase production and reduce the costs. However, centralization has some drawbacks such as rigid and lengthy supply chain issues. In addition, using the small number of very large production facilities to meet the demands might create problems (Almena et al., 2019a) such as closure of the entire facility in case of an outbreak leaving high capacity production lines with less alternatives.\n\nGovernments are also facing financial pressures due to the economic shrinkage and reallocating their resources focusing on financial incentives and social assistance programs. Therefore, it may be difficult to support programs aimed to improve productivity at the farm levels. It is possible that inadequate funding may reduce the demand for agricultural production and productivity over the medium term. The drop in demand will particularly harm the emerging private sector in developing countries (FAO, 2020e, 2020h).\n\nThe information provided by WHO indicated that coronavirus is transmitted through direct contact or respiratory droplets, however, the latest infections encountered in Xinfandi market raised questions over spread of coronavirus through food. Xinfandi market is the Beijing’s largest wholesale food market with more than 10,000 workers and capacity of 18,000 tonnes of vegetables, 20,000 tonnes of fruit, and 1,500 tonnes of seafood, everyday (Hua and Cadell, 2020). Officials have detected more than 100 infected people, mostly serving at seafood, beef, and mutton sections. The coronavirus was detected on the board used for cutting up salmon at market. Officials point out that high humidity and low temperature conditions in Beijing might be the reason for transmission of coronavirus. In addition, officials stated that the surfaces of equipment’s used for preparation of seafood and meat products contaminated by infected people could be another factor of transmission (Feng and Cheng, 2020; Reuters, 2020). The government blocked the entrances by police and temporarily closed the market due to the fears of a second wave of pandemic on June 13. The news has resulted in halted importation of salmon from European countries in China and salmon was taken off from some supermarkets’ shelves in reaction. Norwegian officials stated ‘there is no link between the transmission of coronavirus via imported food and the origin of the salmon outbreak is still unclear’ (Arellano, 2020; Dalton, 2020). Negotiations between Norwegian and Chinese authorities are currently in progress to clear up the backlog. However, not only the supply of seafoods was affected, but also meat, fruit, and vegetables supply were damaged with the closure of the entire Xinfandi market. Authorities are trying to establish special trading places in the near future to maintain the supply chain of vegetables and fruits. In addition, government is considering to take actions to increase the hygienic standards in food markets (Globaltimes, 2020; Reuters, 2020). Authorities tested around 30,000 foods including meat, seafood, fruit, and vegetable between 11 and 17 June and results were negative for all samples. Food exporters to China were asked to sign official declarations in which they give a guarantee for their products that it is not contaminated by coronavirus. However, some of the exporters such as Brazilian grain exporters did not agree to sign the declaration (Good, 2020; Patton, 2020).\n\nAs a result, the COVID-19 pandemic ensured the use of mechanisms designed for emergency and affected contractual transactions in the food supply chains. At the same time, it resulted in the changes in the supply–demand balance and left small producers and operators in a difficult situation (FAO, 2020i).\n\nEffects of pandemic on consumer behaviour\nWhen the issue of how the COVID-19 pandemic affects consumers’ food demand is examined, it is seen that the demand varies depending on the price of foodstuffs, income level of consumers, socio-demographic situation, consumption, and shopping preferences and time constraints. In addition, the number of visits to food store and spending money on food in per visit changed (Bakalis et al., 2020; Cranfield, 2020).\n\nCOVID-19 outbreak interrupted the daily routine and resulted in boredom which can be defined as high energy intake by the consumption of high amount of fat, carbohydrate, and proteins. In addition, quarantine caused stress in people and pushed them toward sugary foods for feeling positive, because carbohydrate-rich foods can be used as self-medicating components due to their ability to encourage serotonin production. However, these unhealthy eating habits may contribute to the development of obesity linked to the chronic inflammation and serious complications of COVID-19 (Muscogiuri et al., 2020).\n\nThe closure of restaurants and limited service eating places affected the eating/purchasing habits and resulted in an unusual demand shift from food service to retail. Reports showed that purchasing food from supermarkets and using food services had the same ratio as 50% before the outbreak; however, it is almost 100% for supermarkets. The number of visits to food store was decreased whilst spending money on food was raised per visit. Consumers experienced reduced availability of certain types of foods during the COVID-19 lockdown. In European countries, flour which is a staple product received more attention and not found on food store shelves due to the interest in home-baking as a family activity. Interestingly, bread and baked products kept their place on the supermarket shelves. Consumers have focused on the products with long shelf life such as dried or canned foods, pasta, milk, or milk substitutes, and frozen foods due to convenience and daily cooking at home. People stocked these foods at home because of the turn to home baking and believing rumours or getting false information. Consumers preferred takeaway and home delivery options as a result of social distance and closure of restaurants (Bakalis et al., 2020; Shahidi, 2020). Indeed, it was interesting to note that the shortage of eggs was not only due to increased demand but also lack of packaging for retail. Household egg consumption increased 40% since March 20 in Argentina and sales of eggs rose by 44% compared to last year in the USA. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration provided flexibility related to the packaging and labelling of eggs due to the insufficient availability of appropriately labelled retail packages to fulfill the demand and facilitate the distribution of eggs during COVID-19 pandemic (FDA, 2020; Mazili, 2020; Reiley, 2020).\n\nGlobal events such as COVID-19 increase the demand for food worldwide. In a study, demand data in European countries due to COVID-19 were evaluated. Accordingly, although the demand for fresh bread increased by 76% and frozen vegetables by 52% in the week when the pandemic was announced, the demand for alcoholic beverages did not increase. However, the demand for alcoholic beverages increased about twice, one month after pandemic announcement (Crisp, 2020).\n\nConcerns about COVID-19 are far-reaching and they cover both health and financial issues. In a study on 18 countries, it was shown that food buying behaviour of the consumers has changed because of their will to consume healthy foods, but at the same time to achieve this without exceeding normal budget. Consumers adopted a basic approach of returning to natural food and beverage products which contain ingredients that provide nutritional supplements such as fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, or olive oil. At the same time, most consumers are concerned about the effect of COVID-19 on their mental effects; therefore, many consumers are looking for food products to improve this mood (Hughes, 2020; Muscogiuri et al., 2020).\n\nIn a recent poll by Italy’s Agricultural Research and Economic Council (CREA), the behaviour of the Italian population on food choices and behaviour was monitored under COVID-19 quarantine. Approximately 2,900 people from all regions of Italy responded. According to the results, healthy food and beverage consumption increased for vegetables (33%), fruit (29%), legumes (26.5%), and extra virgin olive oil (21.5%). However, it was determined that 44.5% of them had more sweet consumption and 16% of them drank more wine. Forty-four percent of respondents reported weight gain due to intake of higher calories and low levels of physical activity. Thirty-seven percent of respondents expressed that they need to lose weight by adjusting their diet (CREA, 2020).\n\nAccording to the survey of 630 consumers in May, 70% of consumers reduced the frequency of food shopping and preferred online shopping during COVID-19 outbreak in the USA. Fifty-six percent of consumers are worried about not finding particular foods they want to buy in the store or forgetting to buy something. Seventy percent of consumers said that they consumed more food while at home. When examined in terms of healthy consumption, 43% of consumers emphasized that they consume more fruits, 42% more vegetables, and 30% more protein-containing foods (meat, chicken, or fish). In addition, 39% of consumers stated that they made their breakfast more balanced. When examined in terms of unhealthy consumption, 47% of consumers said that they consumed more sweets, 24% consumed less vegetables, 21% consumed less fruit, and 19% consumed less protein (DeBroff, 2020).\n\nIn another study, a survey on 1,005 men and women who are over 18 years old showed that more than half of the French people changed their views on the social, economic, and ecological value of food production, during the 8-week quarantine. The results showed that French consumers would only buy ‘necessary’ foods, spend more time cooking, and pay more attention to food spending when the",

This study is a useful supplement to encourage the government to develop regular preventive measures under the era of normalized epidemic.\n\nCOVID-19, deaths, quarantine measures, time series analysis\nTopic: traffic accidentscause of deathchinagovernmentquarantinemortalityepidemicsolder adultpreventioncovid-19\nIssue Section: Original Article\nIntroduction\nCases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause were firstly reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and over the world.1,2 On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the virus COVID-19.3 This novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus is mainly transmitted through respiratory tract and people of any ages are vulnerable.4,5 The elderly and the infirm seem to be more susceptible to the infection of this virus and die of secondary severe respiratory problems or other diseases.6 The global epidemic has caused great losses and challenges to human beings.7,8\n\nPowerful measures have been implemented by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak.9,10 Since 23 January 2020, the bus and subway ferry long-distance passenger service of Wuhan city had been suspended; the airport railway station was temporarily closed and citizens were not allowed to leave Wuhan without special reasons.11 In addition, the media have been following the progress of the epidemic on a daily basis, and the government has publicized the knowledge of disease prevention nationwide to enhance the people’s awareness of self-protection, including less out-going, keeping a social distance and wearing mask when you go out. People throughout the country responded positively to the government’s epidemic prevention measures.12,13\n\nIn the assessment of the evolution and impact of the pandemic, death is one of the clearest and worst outcomes. A national study in the USA estimated the number of excess deaths attributable to COVID-19 of its country from March to May 2020.14 The results show that the number of all-cause deaths is 28% higher than the number of officially reported deaths caused from COVID-19. In contrast, studies have shown that, with the exception of areas with severe outbreaks, such as Wuhan in China, both air pollution reduction and mortality benefit from the quarantine measures.15,16 The number of lives that were saved due to the decrease in air pollution potentially outnumbered the number of deaths directly due to COVID-19.17 Nevertheless, the extent to which the major causes of deaths are affected by epidemic prevention measures remains to be explored.\n\nTo estimate the mortality burden of a new infectious agent in the context of relatively strict quarantine measures, it is common to assess changes in rates of death. Time series analysis is a statistical method of dynamic data processing, which is based on random process theory and mathematical statistics method to study statistical laws followed by random data sequence, so as to solve practical problems.18 Exponential smoothing method and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model concern relatively simple theory and do not contain much mathematics or statistics that are commonly used in time series analysis and prediction methods.19,20 Time series analysis has been successfully used in the field of medicine and public health for time series prediction of epidemic diseases21,22 and has been widely applied to predict trends in COVID-19 prevalence and deaths over the world.23\n\nIn this study, we estimated the expected deaths due to any cause in each month from January to June 2020 about Suzhou, China—a city affected by a mild COVID-19 outbreak if the pathogen had not circulated. We compare these estimates of expected deaths with the reported numbers of deaths to assess the impact of quarantine measures on all-cause mortality. These analyses may enhance our understanding of the importance of quarantine measures to some deaths and serve as useful evidence for formulating health protection guidelines.\n\nMaterials and methods\nData resource\nAll data in this study were obtained from the death cause surveillance database of Suzhou. The objects of the death registration report are all-cause deaths occurring in the area under the jurisdiction of Suzhou carried out by the district health service institutions and secondary or above hospitals. Basic information includes name, sex, date of birth, nationality, marriage, education, occupation, etc. Death information includes cause of death, date of death, place of death, etc. These data included the total number of all-cause deaths in Suzhou from January 2017 to June 2020 and were stratified by month. Descriptive statistics are given in supplementary materials. In this study, a time series containing 3 years, i.e. 36-month data were used to predict the deaths’ numbers in the next 6 months with 95% relative confidence intervals (CIs).\n\nPrediction model\nThe prediction method of time series assumes that the change of the predicted object is only related to time, which is a simplification of the complex effect of external factors. According to its changing characteristics, time series analysis can be used to predict its future state based on the principle of inertia.\n\nExponential smoothing method is a kind of time series analysis and prediction method developed on the basis of moving average method. It is to predict the future of phenomena by calculating exponential smoothing value and combining with a certain time series prediction model. The principle is that the exponential smoothing value of any period is the weighted average of the actual observed value of the period and the exponential smoothing value of the previous period.24\n\nARIMA model refers to the model established by converting non-stationary time series into stationary time series. The dependent variable is only regressed to its hysteresis value and the present value and hysteresis value of the random error term. ARIMA model contains three parameters: p, d and q. `d’ represents the number of order differentiation required for the sequential data to be stable, also known as I. The general formula of AR (p) and MA (q) models can be expressed in equations.25 In addition, ARIMA model can be divided into seasonal model part and non-seasonal model part. Whether there is obvious seasonality can be judged according to the time series diagram.\n\nThe prediction model was selected in exponential smoothing method and ARIMA model using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) for Windows software package (ver.22.0, IBM) expert modeling method. The model choice is based on the stationary R2.\n\nResults\nWe simulated the number of all-cause deaths and the number of deaths from each major cause over the past 36 months (from January 2017 to December 2019) in Suzhou city using a time series model and predict the deaths’ numbers in the next 6 months (January–June 2020). The time series modeler module of SPSS was used to establish the prediction model by using exponential smoothing method, and ARIMA model, respectively, the recommended model of each cause by SPSS, is a ‘simple seasonal’ model of an exponential smoothing method. The fitting effect of each model is shown in Supplementary Table 1. The outcome of these predictions is presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that models have a good fitting effect expect ‘Tumor’. The distribution of deaths from each cause was generally seasonal, with no significant upward or downward trend.\n\nFig. 1\nTrend fitting and prediction of all causes of death in Suzhou from January to June 2020.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTrend fitting and prediction of all causes of death in Suzhou from January to June 2020.\n\n\nThen, we compared these estimates of expected deaths with the reported numbers of deaths and the results are shown in Table 1. From January to March of 2020, the observed numbers of deaths from all causes and each major cause were relatively lower than that of the predicted death numbers. The observed deaths from January to March were 5.36, 7.54 and 7.02% lower than predicted data, respectively. The observed numbers of deaths from respiratory causes and traffic accidents were significantly lower than the predicted numbers statistically (the actual numbers of deaths were outside the 95% CI of the predicted number of deaths). In the first 3 months after quarantine measures (January to March) were implemented, the number of deaths from respiratory causes and traffic accidents declined by 30.1 and 26.9%, respectively. In the following 3 months (April–June), however, the observed numbers of deaths (except respiratory causes and traffic accidents) generally exceeded the predicted numbers. More intuitive difference could be seen in Fig. 2. As seen in Fig. 2, the predicted trend of total death is intersected with the actual observed value with poor consistency. From January to June, there is a ‘U’ trend of first decline and then rise.\n\nTable 2 shows the comparison of 2020 and 2017–2019 deaths from respiratory causes and traffic accidents in Suzhou in the first 3 months by gender and age. As shown in Table 2, the deaths’ numbers from respiratory causes and traffic accidents in the first 3 months of 2020 were lower than that of the average deaths’ numbers of 2017–2019 in both genders and ages. The decline death in respiratory (−39.66% versus −31.16%) and traffic fatalities (−41.18% versus −22.45%) for women was higher than that for men. Among deaths from respiratory diseases, the absolute number over 70 years of age declined for 219 people, accounted for 91.6% of declined death number, and aged over 60 accounted for 68.0% of declined death number in traffic accidents. And women over the age of 80 benefited the most from the respiratory prevention (accounts for 41% of all reductions), whereas women aged over 60 benefited the most from traffic control (44%).\n\nTable 1Comparison of observed and predicted deaths in Suzhou from January to June 2020\nObserved death\tPredicted death (95% CI)\nJanuary\tFebruary\tMarch\tApril\tMay\tJune\tJanuary\tFebruary\tMarch\tApril\tMay\tJune\nAll-cause death \t4958 \t4464 \t4222 \t3940 \t3928 \t3636 \t5239 (4835, 5642) \t4828 (4335, 5320) \t4541 (3973, 5108) \t3807 (3173, 4441) \t3669 (2975, 4363) \t3284 (2535, 4033) \nCirculation system \t1780 \t1616 \t1475 \t1402 \t1340 \t1200 \t1742 (1606, 1878) \t1621 (1483, 1804) \t1494 (1274, 1714) \t1189 (937, 1440) \t1136 (856, 1416) \t1002 (696, 1308) \nCerebrovascular \t1094 \t991 \t923 \t871 \t829 \t759 \t1107 (1016, 1197) \t998 (892, 1104) \t944 (824, 1063) \t768 (637, 899) \t739 (597, 881) \t668 (516, 820) \nCardiopathy \t647 \t587 \t512 \t497 \t466 \t408 \t611 (539, 648) \t606 (517, 694) \t529 (427, 631) \t412 (299, 526) \t389 (264, 513) \t323 (189, 457) \nRespiratory system \t549 \t452 \t347 \t303 \t301 \t293 \t673 (573, 774) \t685 (568, 802) \t557 (425, 689) \t408 (263, 553) \t349 (192, 505) \t286 (118, 454) \nTraffic accident \t68 \t46 \t61 \t58 \t86 \t75 \t95 (78, 113) \t63 (45, 81) \t80 (62, 99) \t74 (56, 93) \t86 (67, 105) \t67 (48, 86) \nEndocrine & metabolic \t258 \t251 \t222 \t196 \t162 \t191 \t290 (252, 328) \t283 (240, 325) \t237 (191, 284) \t189 (138, 239) \t178 (125, 232) \t142 (85, 199) \nOpen in new tab\nFig. 2\nObserved deaths and predicted deaths in Suzhou from January to June 2020.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nObserved deaths and predicted deaths in Suzhou from January to June 2020.\n\nThe observed number of deaths is indicated by the solid line, and the expected number of deaths is indicated by the dashed line.

By comparing with the actual observed death value, the trend change of the death data in January–June 2020 and the difference between the two were analyzed. The results showed that the predicted trend of total death was intersected with the actual observed value with poor consistency. From January to March, the observed number of total deaths was lower than the predicted total deaths, which was mainly caused by respiratory and traffic accidents death decline. From April to June, the observed numbers of total deaths exceeded the predicted deaths.\n\nThe global pneumonia pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus has brought great impact and huge lose on human society. Nevertheless, there is still experience that the epidemic has brought to us. This virus was first reported in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country taking the Spring Festival express. In the face of this highly contagious epidemic, the Chinese people have fought with one heart and one mind. The epidemic has also been brought under effective control by the government’s strong prevention and control measures (such as timely treatment of patients, strict isolation of the infected and contacts, protection of the vulnerable, and so on).26 Reducing travel, limiting congregational activities and wearing masks are key measures to stopping the spread of the disease.27 By the end of June 2020, China had recorded more than 80 000 confirmed cases and more than 4000 deaths, and most provinces have no local additions. This achievement is worthy of recognition (https://voice.baidu.com/act/newpneumonia/newpneumonia).\n\nSuzhou is a large Chinese city located in East China with a population of about 7 million which has a stable population, developed economy and high medical level. During the virus outbreak, we found a declined trend in the number of all-cause deaths in the first few months in Suzhou after the implementation of the national epidemic prevention measures. In February and March, when preventive measures were fully implemented, the number of observed deaths was 7% lower than expected. The number of deaths from respiratory causes and traffic accidents had declined by 30.1 and 26.9% in the first 3 months. During the special period, Suzhou residents reduced their visits to relatives and friends, and hospitals took strict measures of disinfection and epidemic prevention and mask protection. People’s travel was strictly regulated by the government. The very stringent lock-downs were placed in China, leading to significant decrease in air pollution levels, and one study reported that the number of lives that were saved due to the decrease in air pollution potentially outnumbered the number of deaths directly due to COVID-19.17 Another research also found that during and in the months after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the health status of populations in areas where air pollution levels fell appeared to improve.28\n\nIn addition to the significant decline in deaths from respiratory and traffic accidents, deaths from chronic diseases in other systems such as cardiopathy, cerebrovascular disease, endocrine and metabolic also declined. A study reported that improved air quality during the quarantine period avoided death of which were from cardiovascular diseases.17 And our study found that being at home may also associate with fewer deaths from endocrine and metabolic diseases. However, after 3 months, the outbreak was brought under control (Wuhan—the core city of COVID-19 in China—reported no new infections for the first time on 18 March. All the new confirmed cases in the Chinese mainland on 18 March were imported cases.), and social activities gradually returned to normal and medical institutions began to function. At the same time, the observed numbers of deaths of most causes exceeded the predicted numbers. We think that this may be the delayed compensatory death. Due to the opening of the hospital, it caused a rush of medical treatment and increased pressure on medical resources.29\n\nBesides, this study found that the overall age benefited from the prevention measures. The absolute reduction in deaths was greatest among those over 70 years of age during the period of quarantine measures. The decline deaths in respiratory and traffic fatalities for women were both higher than that for men. And women over the age of 80 benefited the most from the respiratory prevention, whereas women aged 60 benefited the most from traffic control. This was likely because in China usually older women over the age of 60 were more likely to go out and buy food, but they were more confined to their homes during the epidemic, which also reduced their exposure to the outside world. We recommend that people, especially the elderly, wear masks on a regular basis when go out in autumn and winter.\n\nLimitations\nThere are some limitations in this study. First, death rates are not compared, which can skew the results slightly. However, according to the results of this study, the main population of all-cause deaths is the elderly over 60 years old, and the floating population in Suzhou city is mainly young adults, which has a relatively low contribution to the death of chronic diseases. Second, Suzhou is just one city, and the larger picture still needs to be explored.\n\nConclusions\nThis study is based on the number of deaths observed in previous years to predict the number of deaths at baseline this year and to compare the observed and predicted number of deaths. We confirmed that under the quarantine measures, the number of all-cause deaths fell and the number of deaths from respiratory causes and traffic accidents were declined most significantly. The whole population would benefit from the epidemic prevention measures. Overall, our study is a useful supplement to encourage the government to develop regular preventive measures under the era of normalized epidemic.\n\nData availability\nOur data are unidentified participant data.

The model captures the effectiveness of various disease suppression measures in three modifiable factors: (a) the per capita contact rate (β) that can be lowered by means of social distancing, (b) infection probability upon contacting infectious individuals that can be lowered by wearing facemasks, personal hygiene, etc., and (c) the population of infectious individuals in contact with the susceptible population, which can be lowered by quarantine. The model was used to make projections on the best approach to exit from the current lockdown.\n\nResults\nThe model was applied to evaluate the epidemiological data and hospital burden in Italy, the UK, and the US. The control measures were identified as the key drivers for the observed epidemiological data through sensitivity analyses. Analysing the different lockdown exit strategies showed that a lockdown exit strategy with a combination of social separation/general facemask use may work, but this needs to be supported by intense monitoring which would allow re-introduction/tightening of the control measures if the number of new infected subjects increases again.\n\nConclusions and relevance\nGovernments should act early in a swift and decisive manner for containment policies. Any lockdown exit will need to be monitored closely, with regards to the potential of lockdown reimplementation. This mathematical model provides a framework for major pandemics in the future.\n\nTopic: italyquarantineinfectionskineticssensitivity analysissars-cov-2covid-19\nIssue Section: Research article\nIntroduction\nThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the infection-related disease (COVID-19) were declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization in early 2020, and have since grown into a pandemic.1,2 COVID-19 has created an unprecedent global health problem, for which most healthcare systems were not well prepared.3\n\nPolicies such as case isolation, social distancing, travel restriction, and quarantine represent the key measures adopted by various governments to control the outbreak.4–7 However, such measures also carry significant impact to individual psychological well-being and social/economic costs. Many epidemiological models8–11 have been proposed to describe the dynamics of the transmission and simulate the course of the outbreak. However, few studies have assessed the impact of the effectiveness of various measures in the control of viral spread. A four-compartment model was established to describe the SARS-CoV-2 infection, assess the potential effectiveness of various infection control measures, and make projections on the best approach to exit lockdown.\n\nMethods\nThe population is divided into the following states: susceptible subjects (S), had close contacts (C, those exposed to infected subjects/pathogen but not necessarily infected), latent (E, infected and infectious but asymptomatic), infected (I; and symptomatic), recovered (V), and dead (D) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary data).\n\nFigure 1.\nFlow diagram of the model. The four-compartment model of disease transmission incorporates the viral transmissibility and the impact of quarantine and social distancing. The population is divided into the following states: susceptible subject(s) (S), had close contact(s) (C, those that were exposed to the infected subjects/pathogen but not necessarily infected), latent (E, infected and infectious but asymptomatic), infected (I; and symptomatic), recovered (V), and dead (D). CM is the portion of the contact cases that are missed by contact tracing and will not be quarantined. Individuals in states C, CM, and CQ will progress to their respective latent groups E, EM (by contact tracing), and EQ (quarantined). After the onset of symptoms, latent individuals will enter the infectious status I, and IQ denoting the infected population treated in isolation wards. It was assumed that when the infected subjects have recovered, they will acquire immunity that does not wane during the timeframe of the analysis (i.e. of this season).\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nFlow diagram of the model.

It was assumed that when the infected subjects have recovered, they will acquire immunity that does not wane during the timeframe of the analysis (i.e. of this season).\n\n\nThe transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is modelled by two separate parameters—the social transmissibility factor β, which measures the probability of having close contact with infectious subjects, and the pathologic transmissibility σ, which measures the probability of an individual developing COVID-19 upon contact with the pathogen.12 The model also allows a predetermined portion of infected individuals to stay latent for the entire incubation period and then move directly to the removed states (recovered or deceased) while bypassing the infected (I) compartment.\n\nThe model was established based on demographic and COVID-19 epidemiological data in Wuhan. Data from Italy, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) fit well with our model, assuming that these countries were affected by multi-sources at around the same time. β in the community was estimated separately. All other parameters were set to the estimated parameters from Wuhan data before 23 January 2020.\n\nResults\nThe four-compartment model and the validation\nIn our four-compartment Susceptible-Quarantined-Infected-Removed (SQIR) model, the transmissibility of COVID-19 is modelled by two factors, the per capita contact rate (β, social interaction factor, when multiplied by the ratio of infectious individuals in the population, describes the probability of a subject moving from status S to status C), and infection rate upon contact (σ, the viral transmission factor, the probability of a subject moving from status C to status E). Together with the quarantine rates (κC and κE), they make up the parameters that can be modified by public health policies to suppress the outbreak. All other parameters in the model are pathogenic/viral characteristics that would not be affected significantly by non-pharmaceutical interventions. The progression rates from latent to infected and from infected to recovered were based on published estimates of 0.1 and 0.0613, respectively, which should remain relatively constant throughout the outbreak.14–16 The natural infection probability upon contact was set at 0.2.12 The rate of COVID-19-related death of all hospitalized cases was set at 4.5%.17\n\nOur model was calibrated18 using 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China between 8 December 2019 and 8 March 202019 (Fig. 2A). The date of the first human COVID-19 latent infection (D0) was set as 3 December 2019 (assuming 5 days before the first symptom of patient zero). The estimation of β was 5.8 under normal social circumstance, and 1.4 after lockdown, and σ was estimated to be 0.04 in the second and third periods, representing roughly a 2-fold decrease from 0.08 during the first period possibly related to the stringent compulsory facemask use policy. Local government estimated that the effective quarantine rate after 31 January 2020 was from 35% to 75%.\n\nFigure 2.\nObserved and modelled case epidemic trajectories.

In the UK, two periods were defined before and after the nationwide lockdown was implemented on 23 March. In the US, two periods were defined before and after the ‘shelter in place’ order in the San Francisco Area on 16 March.\n\n\nApplication of the model to Italy, the UK, and the US\nIn Italy, our model fits, assuming there were four effective sources in Italy at around that time (Fig. 2B).20 The estimated β was 5.5 before social distancing (slightly lower than Wuhan, a metropolitan area densely populated). After nationwide lockdown, β was reduced to 2.8 (starting 10 March) and further reduced to 1.4 (starting 23 March), suggesting that the stricter lockdown in Italy achieved the same effect on β as in Wuhan. Our model assumed 10% effective facemask use compared to Wuhan (σ = 0.076).\n\nFor the UK, our model estimated that the number of effective sources was 6 and β was 4.6 (Fig. 2C). Nationwide lockdown was implemented on 23 March (β = 2.3, σ = 0.076) and strengthened on 31 March (β = 1.5, σ = 0.076).\n\nFor the US, based on CDC data (5 days before the first illness onset), the estimated number of effective sources was 100 (Fig. 2C). Note that the effective number of sources might come down to six, assuming the infection arrived in the US in mid-January 2020.21 The recent report that the SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State had the same genotype as Wuhan, whereas Northeast US had predominately the genotypes related to Europe was consistent with our projection.22 The estimates of β before and after the ‘shelter in place’ order were 5.2 and 2.05, respectively, indicating that US compliance was within reasonable limits and the big jump in numbers was likely related to the multiple sources of virus arriving in the US at the same time.\n\nEffect of case isolation and quarantine\nThis model projected that implementation of case isolation/quarantine is an important measure to control this pandemic. In Wuhan, combining social distancing and compulsory facemask use capped the growth rate of infected cases per day, but not enough to reverse the trend. Adding contact tracing and quarantine (and other measures including general use of facemask) 54 days after D0 completely curbed the outbreak in 69 days. Over the entire course, 32 583 individuals (0.3% of the population) were infected. The model projected that if no quarantine was taken and infection allowed to spread until herd immunity established, 10 111 537 individuals (91.1% of the Wuhan population) would be infected (including 4 494 017 being asymptomatic) at the end of 1 year. For comparison, the annual culminative attack rates of two common human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 were 2.8% and 26.0%, respectively.23\n\nSensitivity analyses\nTo determine the sensitivity of each parameter, they were evaluated/matched to the observed outbreak data24 (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Only the control measures were found to significantly affect the outcome.\n\nEstimation of hospital burden\nAssuming that 15%–25% of all hospitalized individuals needed critical care,17,25,26 the model estimated that the UK's need for hospital beds would plateau after 17 April at around 23 000 and critical care beds around 4600, close to the estimates given by NHS England.\n\nFor the US, the need for hospital beds and critical care units is still growing. Our model estimated that on 18 April 2020, the US needed 98 702 hospital beds (30 per 100 000 people) and around 20 000 critical care beds, and by 15 May (as predicted by our model on 28 April 2020), the US would need an additional 183 320 hospital beds (55 per 100 000 people) and around 37 000 critical care beds. As of 18 April, CDC reported that the overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 29.2 per 100 000 people. By the World Bank's estimation, the US currently has around 1 million hospital beds and 115 000 critical care beds, and, therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic poses a heavy burden on the US healthcare system (the need for 20% more inpatient and 35% more critical care beds). The fact that COVID-19 is very concentrated in New York City/New Jersey suggests even higher projected needs there.\n\nQuarantine rate and quarantine starting time\nThe quarantine starting time after D0 was identified and the effective quarantine rate had the most impact to the outcome (Supplementary Fig. 2). Sensitivity analysis of the quarantine rate of asymptomatic infected subjects (κE) showed a clear breakpoint between 40% and 50%. Quarantine rates lower than 40% would lead to a completely uncontrollable outbreak.\n\nThe impact of a delayed quarantine on the effectiveness of infection control was also significant (Supplementary Fig. 2). By reducing the duration between D0 and the start date of quarantine measures (assuming 80% quarantine rate) from 9 to 7 weeks reduced the overall attack rate from 0.3% to 0.029%. If quarantine measures started after 11 weeks, these measures would not control the outbreak.\n\nEstimating the effect of lockdown and general facemask use\nWe evaluated the impact of lockdown by estimating the projected equivalence of lockdown/social distancing to quarantine (Supplementary Fig. 3A). A stringent lockdown reduced the average social contact by > 2-fold, equivalent to 18% effective quarantine rate. However, the breakpoint of lockdown (i.e. the β that can control the outbreak on its own) was between 0.5 and 1, much lower than the estimated β achieved by lockdown in Italy, the UK, and the US. Thus, the effectiveness of such policy in these countries was reduced as observed.\n\nIn Wuhan, compulsory facemask use reduced σ by 46%, equivalent to 19% effective quarantine rate (Supplementary Fig. 3B). The breakpoint of general facemask use was beyond 100% (around 115%), indicating that general facemask use alone would be insufficient for complete control of the outbreak . This effect was witnessed in Wuhan during the second period (23–31 January). Only after compulsory facemask use was combined with lockdown and quarantine in the third and fourth period (after 31 January) did the number of new cases show a sharp downward trend (Fig. 2A, inset).\n\nThe combined effect of lockdown and general facemask use given different ranges of hospitalization (1%–30%) is given in Fig. 3. During the initial surge of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy/UK/US, no disease control policy was in place (β = 6, σ = 0.08) and hospitalization rate (κI) was close to 5%, with the number of new cases per day doubling every 5 days. Both lockdown and general facemask use could reduce the growth rate of new infections; and when combined give the best overall effect. For lockdown to be effective, β needs to be reduced from 6 to < 1.1. Currently in Italy/UK/US, σ is estimated to decrease only slightly from 0.08 to 0.076. With general facemask use at 50% compliance rate (σ = 0.06), β will need to be < 1.5 to reduce the number of new infections. This level of social distancing was achieved during lockdown in Italy (estimated β = 1.44) and in the UK (estimated β = 1.5), but not yet in the US (estimated β = 2.05). With general facemask use (σ = 0.04), β will only need to be 1.99, which is slightly lower than the current US estimate (β = 2.05). If stricter lockdown and facemask use are implemented together (β = 1.5, σ = 0.04), the number of new cases would reduce by half every 16 days, even without quarantine. Higher hospitalization rate puts more cases under isolation and thus may ease the need for general facemask use. At 15% and 30% hospitalization rate, strict lockdown and compulsory facemask use (β = 1.5, σ = 0.04) would reduce new infection by half in 12 days and 10 days, respectively.\n\nFigure 3.\nContour plots of the effectiveness of disease control by a strategy of combining lockdown and general facemask use. The rate of disease propagation was measured by the doubling time of the number of cases, or disease suppression as measured by the time required to reduce the number of cases by half, at various compliance levels of the lockdown (as measured by the per capita contact rate) and general facemask use (as measured by the effective infection rate upon contact).

All scenarios assumed no quarantine.\n\n\nImplications on the Italian, UK, and US control strategies and exit strategies\nCurrently, most government advisers recommend continuation of lockdown till the outbreak is suppressed to an acceptable level (‘Wuhan approach’), a relatively safe approach. However, some governments are considering an exit to balance the sociopsychological impact of a long lockdown and the huge impact on economy.\n\nIn Italy, for lockdown to continue till zero new infection, it would have to continue until 6 January 2021 (Fig. 4A). For the UK, it would not be until 2023 before the number of new infections dropped to zero (Fig. 4B). The US is still not seeing a firm plateau in the number of new cases and thus it may be even longer until the projection of zero new infection (Fig. 4C).\n\nFigure 4.\nThe effect of lockdown exits strategies. (A-C) the number of cases was compared in the following scenarios: no intervention, keeping the current public health policy, adding quarantine (at different effective ratio) to the current public health policy or adding compulsory general facemask use (at 100% compliance level) to the current public health policy: (A) Italy, (B) UK, and (C) US. Alternative exit strategies are compared with the current public health policy assuming quarantine to be lifted after the number of cases is below 100 in (D) Italy, (E) UK, and (F) US. Various level of social distancing and facemask use and data-driven lockdown policies are considered, including: disease suppression measures completely lifted (β = β0, σ = 0.08), social distancing continues to apply (β = 2.8, σ = 0.08), stringent lockdown continues to apply (β = 1.4, σ = 0.08), social distancing and general facemask use continues to apply (β = 2.35, σ = 0.05), compulsory facemask use continues to apply (β = β0, σ = 0.04). Data-driven lockdowns are also plotted: loosening of social distancing (β = 2.8, σ = 0.08) and completely loosened (β = β0, σ = 0.08). β0: per capita contact (β) rate of the normal social distance in each country. This model can be modified to adapt to different adjusted scenarios.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe effect of lockdown exits strategies.

This model can be modified to adapt to different adjusted scenarios.\n\n\nA more balanced approach would be to reduce the number of new infections to a considerably low level, then relax the infection control policies measures in a controlled fashion with intensive monitoring. Based on our projection, either strict quarantine of contacts, or a combination of both a relatively strict lockdown and general facemask use may be sufficient. It is important to note that the latter approach would need to be used in combination because of (a) the non-linear nature of the effectiveness, and (b) the existence of breakpoints as described above.\n\nWe predict that in Italy, a quarantine policy with an effective quarantine rate of 12% starting on 24 May (18 weeks after D0) in addition to the current implemented lockdown would reduce the incidence of new infections exponentially, reaching ≤ 100 in just 26 days (19 June) and zero in 62 days (24 July). The same infection suppression effect can also be achieved with no active quarantine, but by using the same lockdown as at present, and mandate compulsory facemask use (Fig. 4A). In the UK, lockdown and general facemask use starting on 24 May would bring the incidence of new infections to under 100 in 52 days (15 July) and to zero in 129 days (30 September) (Fig. 4B). This is almost equivalent to an effective quarantine rate of 10%. An effective quarantine rate of 20% would bring the incidence of new infections to under 100 in 35 days (28 June) and to zero in 70 days (2 August). In the US, general facemask use starting on 24 May would bring the incidence of new infections to under 100 in 152 days, which is equivalent to a quarantine effective rate of 9%. If the government can achieve 20% effective quarantine rate, the incidence of new infections will drop to around 100 in 65 days (28 July).\n\nImplementing a monitoring-based, data-driven lockdown exit strategy is essential to sustain the containment of COVID-19. Based on our model, loosening the quarantine too early while there are still a significant number of latent cases may lead to an uncontrollable second outbreak. With daily active monitoring of new infection numbers, it is possible to adjust the infection control policies to maintain new infections within a band trending downwards. As discussed, lockdown should only be loosened to social distancing (β = 2.8) and general facemask use when daily new infections are reduced to a very low number (e.g. 100 cases) and re-implemented to an aggressive lockdown (β = 1.4, similar to the lockdown in Italy) with general facemask use when daily new infections is rising (e.g. ≥1000 cases). This approach will provide the time for vaccine, drugs, or other pharmaceutical interventions to catch up while allowing economical activities to be less uninterrupted in regions with low numbers of new infections.\n\nFor Italy (Fig. 4D), if the quarantine is lifted after daily new infections drops to < 100 (June 19) with all infection suppression policies currently in place (β = 5.53, σ = 0.08), the number of new infections would quickly return to exponential growth. Even with general facemask use (β = 5.53, σ = 0.04), a second wave of outbreak is still inevitable. Thus, the quarantine should last till the incidence of new infections is close to zero (on 24 July), plus a 2-week wash out period (the estimated latent period) before implementing exit.\n\nIn the UK, if quarantine is lifted after daily new infections drops to < 100 (15 July) along with all current infection suppression policies (β = 4.6, σ = 0.08), it would only take 36 days (20 August) for the incidence of new infections to reach 10 000. However, an extended lockdown and quarantine that lasts 129 days (until 30 September to eliminate new incidences) would also be less plausible economically and politically. Thus, we recommend that after the outbreak is suppressed to an acceptable level, restrictions can be relaxed gradually to keep the infection under control, allowing economic activities to recover.\n\nIn the US, to effectively reduce the size of the outbreak, quarantine should remain in effect at > 20% rate. With quarantine, the number of daily new cases is projected to be < 100 by 28 July. Afterwards, a monitoring-based, data-driven approach can be implemented. The same level of lockdown or social distancing plus general facemask use should continue. It should be noted that a full cycle of loosening and re-implementation would span 53 days if during the loosening period, the infection control policies were completely lifted (β = 5.2), or 89 days if loosened to social distancing (β = 2.8).\n\nDiscussion\nIn this study a four-compartment mathematical model was established for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be useful in the policy decision-making process. Second, our model suggested that Italy, the UK, and USA likely had multiple sources of infections to account for the observed early sharp rise in the number of infected subjects. Third, effective and early implementation of quarantine were the two most important factors for control of the outbreak. Fourth, the relative contributions of quarantine, lockdown, social distancing, and the general facemask use were estimated. Finally, different strategies for lockdown exit were evaluated and challenges identified. Our model allows examination of the issues unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highly infectious nature of this pathogen, the potential of this infection to overwhelm the healthcare system, and the alternative containment strategy implemented for this pandemic.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses showed that, in the time from the index patient to control measures and effective quarantine, measures were most effective when the majority of the infected carriers, mostly asymptomatic27–31, were put under quarantine. Our data support the latest recommendation from the US CDC on the use of facemasks in public during this pandemic.\n\nOnce the outbreak is under control, quarantine can be lifted through a data-driven, monitoring-based dynamic disease mitigation policy. Thus, general availability of a rapid viral diagnostic test is critical. A real challenge will be the potential to have both SARS-CoV-2 and other upper respiratory viral pathogens prevalent at the same time (e.g. this winter) when this pandemic is still ongoing. If this occurs, our model will require adjustment for two pathogens simultaneously. Our data highlight the importance for governments to act swiftly and decisively for any containment policies.32 Also, any lockdown exit must be monitored closely with the potential for lockdown reimplementation.\n\nConclusions\nThis four-compartment mathematical model describes SARS-COV-2 infection, can be adjusted to reflect local transmission characteristics and public health capabilities, can help to determine the optimal local disease suppression strategy, and can help when making projections for the best local lockdown exit strategy.",

Fitzpatrick, Casey Harris, Grant DrawveUniversity of Arkansas, FayettevilleThe intent of this work was to examine the intersection of COVID-19 fear with social vulnerabilities andmental health consequences among adults living in the United States. Data are from a nationallyrepresentative sample (n\u000210,368) of U.S. adults surveyed online during demographic subgroups(gender, age, income, race and ethnicity, geography). The sample week of March 23, 2020. The samplewas poststratification weighted to ensure a balanced representation across social and demographicsubgroups (gender, age, income, race or ethnicity, geography). The sample comprised 51% female; 23%non-White; 18% Hispanic; 25% of households with children under 18 years of age; 55% unmarried; andnearly 20% unemployed, laid off, or furloughed at the time of the interview. Respondents were fearful,averaging a score of nearly 7 on a scale of 10 when asked how fearful they were of COVID-19.Preliminary analysis suggests clear spatial diffusion of COVID-19 fear. Fear appears to be concentratedin regions with the highest reported COVID-19 cases. Significant differences across several U.S. censusregions are noted (p\u0003.01). Additionally, significant bivariate relationships were found between sociallyvulnerable respondents (female, Asians, Hispanic, foreign-born, families with children) and fear, as wellas with mental health consequences (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Depressive symptoms, onaverage, were high (16\u0004on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), and more than 25%of the sample reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. More in-depth psychosocial research isneeded using nationally representative samples that can help to inform potential mental health risks, aswell as by targeting specific mental health interventions.Keywords:fear, COVID-19 pandemic, mental health, depression, anxietyAmerica’s mental health is being threatened by the currentpublic health crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed morethan 70,000 lives in 4 short months and hospitalized hundreds ofthousands of people, and there are now over 1.3 million confirmedcases reported in the United States (“Coronavirus in the U.S.,”2020). As these numbers continue to grow, this public health crisishas already taken and will continue to take a mental toll onAmerica’s families, communities of color, and the at-risk (KaiserFamily Foundation, 2020). Indeed, the coming months will likelymimic the experiences of other outbreak locations because recentwork coming out of Europe and China has started to providepreliminary evidence from population surveys showing signifi-cantly elevated symptomatology levels in depression, anxiety,general stress, and posttraumatic stress related to COVID-19(Cowan, 2020;Huang & Zhao, 2020;Qiu et al., 2020;Sønderskov,Dinesen, Santini, & Østergaard, 2020;Stankovska, Memedi, &Dimitrovski, 2020;C. Wang et al., 2020;Y. Wang, Di, Ye, & Wei,2020;Zhang et al., 2020). Unsurprisingly, the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic is beginning to be felt across multiple oc-cupational, social, economic, and geographic boundaries in theUnited States—uncertainty, fear, and a new level of stress may beslowly seeping into the American psyche, with consequences thathave yet to be fully understood. As the pandemic continues to wearon, it is likely that widespread negative mental health conse-quences will be reported with the potential for long-lasting effects.For instance, evidence from a recent poll by the Kaiser FamilyFoundation reported that nearly half of the adults surveyed indi-cated their mental health was being negatively impacted becauseof worry, stress, and anxiety caused by the coronavirus (KaiserFamily Foundation, 2020), and a National Public Radio poll foundsimilar results even before a pandemic was declared (NationalPublic Radio, 2020).MethodDataIn an effort to better understand some of the mental healthconsequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have begun a com-prehensive study examining the diffusion of fear across both timeand place in the United States. Specifically, our work is interestedin documenting the variation in COVID-19 fear across geographicboundaries (i.e., regions, states, counties), while also describingthe variability of fear across socially vulnerable population sub-Editor’s Note.This commentary received rapid review due to the time-sensitive nature of the content.

An onlinesurvey was released on March 23, 2020, through Qualtrics Inc.to a national panel of U.S. residents who participated in theinstitutional review board–approved survey. Questions assessedgeneral fear, worry, and anxiety related to COVID-19 andsocial and behavioral health changes, as well as physical andmental  health  assessments.  The  final  sample  was  post-stratification-weighted across gender, age, race, income, andgeography (state) to ensure the equitable contribution to ourestimates of respondents across their individual demographicand geographic strata relative to their representation in theoverall population of the United States.MeasurementA number of measures were used in this preliminary analysisof COVID-19 fear, social vulnerabilities, and mental healthconsequences. For the current study, respondents were asked torank, on a sliding scale of 0–10, “How would you currently rateyour fear of COVID-19 where 0\u0002not at all fearful to 10\u0002very fearful?” In addition to the nine-category U.S. regionvariable (Northeast New England, Northeast Mid-Atlantic,Midwest East North Central, Midwest West North Central,South-South Atlantic, South East South Central, South WestSouth Central, West Mountain, West Pacific), several socialvulnerability variables were included in the analysis: gender,race, Hispanic status, nativity, marital status, household com-position, and work status. Finally, two highly reliable and validmental health measures were included. One was the Center forEpidemiologic Studies Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), whichmeasures depressive symptomatology; for the current data, theinternal reliability score was .94. The other mental health con-sequence was the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD-7) scale (Löwe et al., 2008;Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams,& Löwe, 2006), which screens for generalized anxiety and forthe current data had an internal reliability score of .94.ResultsWhat follows are some observations in the early weeks of ouryearlong study of COVID-19 in America. Paralleling the find-ings of the Kaiser Family Foundation (Kaiser Family Founda-tion, 2020) and other researchers (e.g.,Cowan, 2020;Qiu et al.,2020;C. Wang et al., 2020), we observed a population that isworried, fearful, and uncertain about COVID-19 and the con-sequences it will have for themselves, their families, commu-nities, and nation. Yet, unique to our study, COVID-19 fear isnot uniformly distributed across the country, and there are clearpockets of concentrated COVID-19 fear in more densely pop-ulated communities, communities with higher presumptive andreported COVID-19 case concentrations, and urban locations.COVID-19 fear has not escaped the rest of the country; it hasjust become more elevated in places with specific populationand place-based circumstances.Gleaned fromFigure 1, there are higher concentrations ofCOVID-19 fear in the Northeast New England region, North-east Mid-Atlantic region, South-South Atlantic Region, andWest Pacific. Not surprising, these regions and the major citieslocated within those regions also reported some of the highestdensities in terms of confirmed COVID-19 cases.To examine the details ofFigure 1more closely,Table 1reports average fear in each of the nine U.S. Census regions. Aone-way analysis of variance found a significant difference (Ftest) across regions (p\u0003.000); specifically Scheffé’s multiplecomparisons (p\u0003.05) found statistically significant differencesin COVID-19 fear levels between the Northeast New Englandand West Mountain regions, Northeast Mid-Atlantic and WestMountain regions, South-South Atlantic and West Mountainregions, and West Mountain and West Pacific regions.Moreover, COVID-19 fear is not equally distributed acrossthe population: female, Asian, Hispanic, foreign-born individ-uals; families with children; married persons; and persons whoare currently laid off or furloughed reported much higher levelsof COVID-19 fear than did their counterparts. These populationsubgroup differences are noted inTable 2using a difference ofmeans test (ttest). Finally, in addition to these varying popu-lation subgroup differences, we found that COVID-19 fear isclearly linked to both depression and anxiety symptomatology;persons reporting more COVID-19 fear reported more mentalhealth symptoms.DiscussionCOVID-19 fear has a number of ramifications beyond mentalhealth. We were particularly interested in the relationship be-tween COVID-19 fear, social vulnerabilities, and mental healthconsequences, and the preliminary analyses highlight somesignificant relationships between a variety of social vulnerabil-ities and COVID-19 fear, as well as COVID-19 fear and mentalhealth symptomatology. Surveyed respondents reported meandepressive symptom levels that are in the clinical casenessterritory (16\u0004). Although anxiety scores for the entire sampleare mild, more than 25% of respondents reported moderate tosevere anxiety symptom scores, where clinical treatment iswarranted.COVID-19 fear, and the poor mental health that accompaniesit, also means some communities will face a steeper uphillbattle to recover from this public health crisis. Additionalpreliminary data analysis (not shown here) reveal individualsexperiencing greater levels of depression amid the pandemic arealso less likely to support quarantine measures (voluntary ormandatory), canceling of mass gatherings and events, or closingbusinesses. Of course, without extreme physical distancingmeasures in place, recovery may be incomplete, with the dooropen for a second wave of coronavirus infections or a surge inthe current wave due to government reopenings. In short, fear ofthe virus, and subsequent mental health problems that follow,remain entangled with the types of policies and measures usedto combat the virus, both now and as recovery unfolds and theUnited States begins to slowly move forward.We believe that the findings reported here provide a “firstimpact” glimpse into how the COVID-19 pandemic is beingprocessed and reacted to by the general U.S. adult population.Although these early findings are important, there are somelimitations that should be noted. One, although these dataThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.S18FITZPATRICK, HARRIS, AND DRAWVE\nFigure 1.Aggregated individual fear of COVID-19 across U.S. counties.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.S19COVID-19 FEAR AND MENTAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES\nprovide an important snapshot of individuals’ perspectives andreactions, it is only that. These cross-sectional data do not allowfor longitudinal conclusions that might be related to cause andeffect. Nevertheless, having these snapshots of population be-havior and reaction are critical for marking this importantpublic health crisis and its impact on the country’s collectivemental health. Two, there are a number of other measuresregarding fear, attitude, mental health, and circumstance thatcould have been used. We recognize some of the shortcomingsin our single-item measures; however, the immediacy of gettinginto the field, coupled with the need to limit the amount of timethat respondents needed to complete the survey, impacted ourdecision-making and ultimately the survey design. Finally, weacknowledge that although this survey was poststratification-weighted to ensure adequate representation across the U.S.population, because of the online platform used to collect data,it is likely that the data overrepresent urban, middle-classresidents and underrepresents rural, lower class residents. De-spite these and other shortcomings, we believe that these data,to our knowledge, provide an important early look at the de-veloping mental health tsunami that is likely to impact the U.S.mental health care system in the weeks and months ahead.Do we have a mental health care system that is prepared toadequately respond to these elevated needs? There is already asevere shortage of mental health care workers in the UnitedStates. Moreover, the U.S. medical insurance system often doesnot adequately cover the mental health needs of millions of itsresidents, whereas job loss, business shutdowns, and othercircumstances that are well beyond individuals’ control likelyeliminated what little coverage and access existed for many.The impact that is being felt is immediate, though its conse-quences are going to be long-lasting. Our medical care systemneeds to be ready to ramp up for the onslaught of persons withsevere mental health care needs, particularly in light of wide-spread (but unequal) fear of COVID-19 and the symptomologythat follows, requiring sustained assistance and support.",

Washington\nUniversity School of Medicine in St. Louis, Saint Louis,\nMissouri, United States, 2. Washington University in\nSt. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, United States\nReports emerged early in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic\nthat older adults were foregoing non-COVID19-related\ncare, due to fears of contracting the virus during appointments and because of healthcare providers’ reduced operations. Beginning in July, 2020, we explored the impact of\nthe pandemic on disruptions to care and older adults’ use of\ntelehealth. Preliminary results from 53 older adults aged 66\nto 93 (mean: 72.6) found that many older adults experienced\ndisruptions in their care, ranging from 30-50% depending\non the type of care. The most commonly disrupted care types\nwere mental health and rehabilitation care (occupational,\nphysical, or speech therapy), with 50% of older adults reporting disruptions to mental health and 50% to rehabilitation care. The most common reason for the disruptions was\nclosed care providers’ offices. Similar results were found for\nprimary care (46% reporting disruptions), dental care (44%),\nand vision care (30%), with between 62-71% citing closed\noffices as a reason for the disruption. The use of telehealth\namong the sample was high (44%), and the majority (83%)\nof these older adults reported never having used it previously.\nAll who used it reported being very or somewhat comfortable with the technology, and 83% said they would use it\nagain even if in-person care was available. These findings\nsuggest the pandemic has had a significant impact on older\nadults’ care and that the expansion of telehealth could be increase access to care during and after the pandemic.\nDUAL CAREGIVERS OF RELATIVES WITH DEMENTIA\nIN RURAL VIRGINIA: THE ADDED STRESS OF\nCOVID-19\nEmily Hoyt,1\n Jyoti Savla,\n1\n Karen Roberto,\n1\n\nAubrey L.

Serving in a dual caregiving role presents unique challenges and has consequences for caregivers’\nphysical and mental health. Seven daily diary interviews with\n46 dual dementia caregivers assessed their daily stressors\nand informal and formal supports. Results showed that dementia caregivers who also cared for another older relative\nreported poorer physical health and used more communitybased services to care for the PwD. Conversely, dementia\ncaregivers who also cared for younger relatives reported\ngreater secondary stressors, lower family support, and use\nof fewer community-based services to care for the PwD.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, two telephone interviews were conducted with 15 dual dementia caregivers.\nCaregivers were asked in-depth questions about how the\npandemic had impacted their caregiving responsibilities,\nmental health, and use of community-based services. Guided\nby stress process and behavior models, a thematic analysis of\ndual caregivers’ interviews revealed that caregivers had less\ntime for themselves, engaged in self-care activities less often,\nand felt their social life had suffered. Many of the caregivers\nreported feeling exhausted, stressed, and had more things\nto do than they could handle. Of the eight caregivers that\nused services before COVID-19, six experienced a change in\nservices including loss of services, different workers, or selfselected cancellation of services.

Asebedo  Yi Liu  Blake Gray  Taufiq Hasan Quadria\nFirst published: 06 January 2021 https://doi.org/10.1002/cfp2.1101\n\nAbstract\nThis study investigates how Americans used their CARES Act Economic Impact Payments (EIP) for their spending needs, spending wants, and financial transactions. The results from a sample of 1,172 Amazon MTurk users collected in July 2020 suggest that EIP use varied across spending and financial transaction categories. Those with job instability, less financial resources, and more people to care for received essential support. A smaller proportion of the population spent at least some of their EIP on their wants. Americans' primarily focused their EIP spending on housing, food, and hobbies. In addition, people were able to improve their financial situation through investing and debt reduction. Decisions to save the EIP were related to economic recovery concerns; a broad policy package and public messaging strategy that offers assurance of economic recovery and stability might enhance policy effectiveness for boosting immediate economic growth through EIP spending.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe COVID‐19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on U.S. society, the economy, and consumer spending. The pandemic has resulted in historically high unemployment rates (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020), with more than 51 million workers filing for unemployment benefits for the first time (Department of Labor, 2020). To alleviate the economic effects of COVID‐19 and to stimulate the economy, the U.S. government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). One of the major components of the CARES Act consisted of direct payments to individuals, called Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), to provide immediate relief and to stimulate consumer spending (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2020). The CARES Act offered people a financial safety net and a choice about how to allocate their EIPs across their spending needs and wants, and their financial situation (such as saving and debt reduction).\n\nGiven the extensive cost of the CARES Act and the decision‐making opportunity for EIP use placed before Americans, the purpose of this study is twofold: to investigate how Americans chose to use their EIPs, and to determine the behavioral, economic, and demographic factors associated with those decisions. Additionally, this study aims to discern how individuals allocated their EIPs within major subcategories, such as saving, investing, housing, transportation, travel, education, hobbies, and charitable donations. It is important for policymakers to determine how people tend to use stimulus payments, like the CARES Act EIPs, and the factors associated with their decision‐making to inform future legislation aimed at supporting Americans' financial and overall well‐being. Beyond public policy implications, more information about how people use their EIPs provides financial planners with insight into how people vary in their financial needs, wants, and goals during an economic crisis; and how professionals might offer advice during times of stability to help their clients prepare for future uncertainty. This study builds upon Shapiro and Slemrod (2003, 2009) and Leigh (2012) by investigating economic stimulus payment use within the context of the COVID‐19 health pandemic for spending needs, spending wants, and financial transactions; furthermore, this study incorporates detailed subcategories such as saving, investing, debt repayment, housing, food, hobbies, travel, donations, etc. In addition, this study generates unique data about respondents' view of their spending as a need or a want. While researchers have studied economic stimulus payment use during other economic crises (e.g., 2007–2009), research for COVID‐19 economic stimulus spending is only beginning.\n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1 Economic stimulus payment programs\nPolicymakers use economic stimulus payment programs in response to large‐scale economic recessions to address two major challenges: individual economic hardship and stimulation of the broader economy (Kaplan & Violante, 2014b). For example, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 provided $300 to $600 Federal stimulus payments for U.S. households and reduced the tax rate during the 2001 economic recession. Similarly, policymakers responded to the Great Recession of 2007–2009 with economic stimulus payments under the Economic Stimulus Act (ESA) of 2008 that were designed to increase aggregate consumption and savings, mitigate the effects of the recession on Americans, and invigorate a stagnant economy. The base ESA payments ranged from $300–$600 for single individuals, $600–$1,200 for couples, and an additional $300 per child for households who qualified for the child tax credit. More recently, policymakers signed the CARES Act into law to mobilize economic relief and to stimulate the economy in response to the economic crises resulting from the 2020 COVID‐19 health pandemic. According to the CARES Act, a single U.S. citizen (or U.S. resident alien) with an adjusted gross income under $75,000 (phased out up to $99,000) received the full $1,200 economic impact payment (EIP); married couples filing jointly without children with an adjusted gross income below $150,000 (gradually phased out up to $198,000) received a $2,400 EIP; in addition, households who qualified for the child tax credit received $500 per child.\n\n2.2 Economic stimulus payment decision making\nWhether individuals optimize the relief and economic effects of stimulus payments partially depends on how they use the money, which has generated research interest regarding how people respond to economic stimulus payments and tax rebates (Broda & Parker, 2014; Cole, Thompson, & Tufano, 2008; Coronado, Lupton, & Sheiner, 2005; Kaplan & Violante, 2014a, 2014b; Misra & Surico, 2014). For example, Parker, Souleles, Johnson, and McClelland (2013) found that households spent about 12–30% of their stimulus payments (on average) on nondurables (e.g., food, clothing, and gasoline). Similarly, Leigh (2012) found that 40% of households allocated their 2008 ESA payment towards spending, while 24% allocated it towards saving and 35% towards debt reduction. Broda and Parker (2014) found that households increased their spending by about 10% during the week they received their 2008 ESA payments; this result was more pronounced for low‐income and low‐wealth households, which is consistent with recent research that found economic stimulus payments increased spending (for mainly nondurables) among low‐income households (Baker, Farrokhnia, Meyer, Pagel, & Yannelis, 2020; Chetty, Friedman, Hendren, & Stepner, 2020).\n\nWhile research is more limited, studies have found that behavioral, economic, and demographic characteristics are associated with economic stimulus payment spending. Shapiro and Slemrod (2009) found that those with positive expectations of the economy (behavioral) were substantially more likely to spend their 2008 ESA payment rather than save. Lower income households compared to higher‐income households (economic) tended to use their 2008 ESA payments in ways that produced stimulative economic effects because they spent more of their payments, whereas higher income households were more likely to save and invest (Elmendorf & Furman, 2008; Orszag, 2008). Furthermore, Shapiro and Slemrod found that older adults (demographic) were more likely to spend more of their 2008 ESA payment. However, Shapiro and Slemrod did not incorporate spending categories; therefore, it is unclear where and in what ways the 2008 ESA payments were spent and how these trends differed by demographic characteristics.\n\n2.3 Other factors related to financial behavior affecting pre‐crisis preparation\nThe economic stimulus payment literature centers upon higher level themes, such as saving and spending; therefore, it is necessary to review the broader literature to determine other behavioral, economic, and demographic factors that might affect people's pre‐crisis financial preparation that contribute to their stimulus payment decision making.\n\n2.3.1 Behavioral\nPlanning, investing, and seeking advice are pre‐crisis behaviors. For example, people who consult with a financial planner tend to contribute more towards retirement savings and have higher incomes (Martin Jr & Finke, 2014); however, those who primarily consult with family are more likely to have a low income (Chang, 2005). Risk tolerance is related to long‐term planning behavior and a greater likelihood of being a saver (Fisher & Anong, 2012). Risk tolerance is positively correlated with investing in riskier assets, such as holding a greater proportion of stocks in addition to experiencing greater investment returns (Corter & Chen, 2006; Heo, Nobre, Grable, & Ruiz‐Menjivar, 2016).\n\nStock ownership and stock market performance also influence consumption decisions. People tend to spend more money when stock prices are increasing, with spending on durable goods increasing more than nondurables (Poterba, Samwick, Shleifer, & Shiller, 1995). Households also spend more on food when stock prices increase but dining out increases at a much higher rate than dining in (Mankiw & Zeldes, 1991). A positive economic outlook, or the wealth effect caused by increased statement balances, can explain this higher spending. When expectations are low, individuals increase savings (precautionary savings), spend more on needs, and less on wants (Coibion, Gorodnichenko, & Weber, 2020). The results from Coibion et al. (2020) align with results from Reed and Crawford (2014), who found that people reduce spending during recessions with the deepest reductions concentrated in travel, transportation, and clothing expenses, while spending on housing, utilities, and food decline by the least (Reed & Crawford, 2014).\n\n2.3.2 Economic and demographic\nLower income and wealth households consumed their 2001 tax rebate at a rate of 10–40 cents per dollar, whereas those with higher income and liquid wealth varied considerably in their consumption patterns—spending either $0 or most (Misra & Surico, 2011). Those who are younger, have few liquid assets, and lower income are more likely to spend money on nondurable goods (e.g., food; Souleles, 1999, 2002). Those with higher subjective and objective financial literacy are more likely to have emergency savings (Babiarz & Robb, 2014), less debt (Gathergood, 2012), and more investments (Xiao, Chen, & Sun, 2015). Income is also important to saving behavior: Mills and Amick (2010) found that those with higher incomes were savers who were prepared for future income instability. Furthermore, Maroto (2018) found that individuals with a higher net worth were able to save and invest more than those with a lower net worth, and that households with more children saved less, spent more on needs, and spent less on wants. These pre‐crisis financial behaviors may affect the use of stimulus payments during a crisis, as liquidity constrained households rely on stimulus payments to provide basic necessities, while others can rely more on savings.\n\n3 THEORY\nUnder the traditional life cycle hypothesis, individuals contend with present and future spending by smoothing consumption through the use of debt and savings to maximize utility over the life cycle (Ando & Modigliani, 1963). Money is considered fungible within this approach (i.e., without labels or accounts) with each dollar treated the same as another regardless of its source; however, research has shown that spending and saving habits deviate quite markedly from these assumptions. To explain these deviations, Shefrin and Thaler (1988) developed the behavioral life cycle hypothesis (BLCH) introducing that money is nonfungible (i.e., different sources are not treated in the same manner), and that an individual's proclivity to spend is affected by self‐control, mental accounting, and framing. Under the BLCH, money is often assigned to one of three mental accounts depending on its source and intended use with a varying temptation to spend (i.e., marginal propensity to consume; MPC): (a) current income (high MPC), (b) current assets (moderate MPC), and (c) future income (low MPC; Shefrin & Thaler, 1988). For example, money within a retirement savings account (future income or a current asset) is often viewed and spent differently than money from an individual's paycheck (current income). Additionally, an individual's preference for ambiguity affects how they approach decision making with uncertain outcomes, further complicating the decision‐making process for spending income and assets (Kahn & Sarin, 1988).\n\nThe BLCH motivates the main hypothesis of this study: individuals seek to maximize utility in the disposition of their CARES Act economic impact payment (EIP) by choosing goods or services with characteristics that match preferences affected by the current economic environment. Due to the combined psychological, economic, and demographic effects contributing to people's COVID‐19 experience, it is expected that behavioral elements under the BLCH (such as self‐control, framing, and mental accounting) will affect how Americans choose to use their EIP. Furthermore, the CARES Act EIP is considered an unexpected windfall under the BLCH, where a household had limited or no opportunity to adjust prior saving behavior to account for this future income (Shefrin & Thaler, 1988). Therefore, Americans are likely to frame their EIPs as a current income windfall that carries a higher MPC than that of non‐windfall gains (Arkes Hal et al., 1994; Shefrin & Thaler, 1988). The BLCH provides insight into how people might frame and use their CARES Act EIP, thereby informing these two hypotheses:\n\nH1: Americans are more likely to frame their EIP as a current income windfall and therefore allocate more of their payment towards spending because of a higher MPC.\n\nH2: Americans are less likely to frame their EIP as a current asset or future income and therefore will be less likely to allocate more of their payment towards financial transactions that result in wealth accumulation outcomes (i.e., save, invest, or reduce debt).\n\n4 METHOD\n4.1 Data analysis and sample\nThis study employed ordered probit models for each dependent variable given the ordinal measurement described below. Marginal effects are calculated to determine the magnitude of the effects on each observed dependent variable. Survey data were generated through a sample of American adults aged 18 and over from Amazon's MTurk platform. This survey method facilitated a prompt data gathering process during the time of EIP receipt with a more diverse population than a traditional convenience sample (Berinsky, Huber, & Lenz, 2011); however, it is important to note that the MTurk population is not considered representative of the U.S. population (Goodman, Cryder, & Cheema, 2013). The survey was developed with Qualtrics and distributed through MTurk under the title “Covid‐19 Economic Stimulus Use Survey.” The sample consisted of 1,172 survey respondents who indicated they received an EIP, had used at least a portion of it for spending or financial transactions, had at least a 95% HIT (Human Intelligence Task or survey) approval rating, and had completed at least 500 HITs. Respondents were paid $1.50 for completing the survey. About 50% of the sample came from these states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia; the largest proportion of respondents resided in California, Texas, and Florida (27.58%). Given the use of human subjects, this study was reviewed and approved by the Texas Tech University Human Research Protection Program (IRB2020‐508).\n\n4.2 Measurement\n4.2.1 Dependent variables\nThere are 26 dependent variables, estimated through 26 separate ordered probit models. Within the survey, respondents first indicated how they allocated their EIP to these broad categories: spending needs, spending wants, and financial transactions. Responses were analyzed as three separate dependent variables through three distinct models. If respondents indicated they used at least a little of their EIP in one or more of these broad categories, they were then asked to indicate how they used their EIP within subcategories. Spending need and spending want subcategories included (a) housing, (b) food, (c) clothing, (d) transportation, (e) travel, (f) donation, (g) children, (h) education, (i) hobby and recreation, and (j) health care. Each of these subcategories (10 for needs, and 10 for wants) were analyzed as separate dependent variables through 20 different models. If respondents indicated they used at least a little of their EIP for financial transactions, they were then asked to indicate how they used their EIP within three subcategories: saving, investing, and debt repayment. Each of these financial transaction subcategories was analyzed as separate dependent variables through three different models. Each dependent variable is measured on a five‐point Likert scale, indicating the extent to which respondents used their EIP within a particular category: (a) none at all, (b) a little, (c) some, (d) most, or (e) all.\n\nThe dependent variables were designed to capture the potential allocation of the EIP across multiple spending and financial transaction categories. Therefore, it is possible for respondents to be included in more than one model. To control for possible response error across multiple categories, respondents were restricted from signifying they spent most or all on more than one category. Additionally, if most was selected in one category, respondents were not allowed to answer some, most, or all for any other category. For example, a respondent could select most for spending needs, none for spending wants, and a little for financial transactions. In response to the subsequent questions for the subcategories, the respondent could indicate they spent all of their spending needs allocation on food, whereas for financial transactions they could indicate they used most of the proportion allocated to financial transactions for debt repayment and a little for savings. In this case, based on skip logic employed through Qualtrics, the survey would not ask the respondent about subcategories for spending wants because they indicated none for that main category. Figure 1 provides a visual depiction of this survey flow.\n\nimage\nFIGURE 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nSurvey flow\n4.2.2 Explanatory variables\nTo capture individuals' monetary needs, decision‐making, spending preferences, and financial behaviors during times of crisis, the survey was constructed with variables that encompass behavioral, economic, and demographic factors, including (a) behavioral: who respondents consulted with about EIP decision making, subjective financial literacy, objective financial literacy, financial‐risk‐taking attitude, stock ownership, changes in stock allocation, COVID‐19 economic recovery outlook, recession expectations, stock market expectations, and mask‐wearing and social distancing preferences; (b) economic: workforce status, change in workforce status, EIP amount, net wealth, and income; and (c) demographic: age, gender, race, education, marital status, and the number of household dependents.\n\nBehavioral. The primary consultant (if any) for EIP decision making was measured by asking respondents: “Who was (or will be) the primary person or professional that was (or will be) most influential in your decision‐making?” There were seven possible responses: (a) financial planner/ advisor, (b) accountant, (c) other professional, (d) family member(s), (e) friend(s), (f) other, and (g) I did not consult with anyone. Subjective financial literacy was measured from 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree) in response to this statement: “I have a high level of overall financial knowledge.” Objective financial literacy was measured by the sum of scores for six questions about interest, inflation, bond prices, compound interest, mortgages, and diversification (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2011, 2017). The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for objective financial literacy is low at 0.59 in this study's sample; however, this measure is widely used in the literature and the Cronbach's alpha is within the range of other samples: 0.56–0.84 (Murphy, 2013; Sarigül, 2014; Skagerlund, Lind, Strömbäck, Tinghög, & Västfjäll, 2018). Perceived willingness to take financial risk (financial‐risk‐taking attitude) was measured on a 0 (lowest risk level) to 10 (highest risk level) scale with this question from Dohmen et al. (2011): “How willing are you to take risks in financial matters?” Stock ownership was a binary variable (yes/no), with those indicating stock ownership if they replied “yes' to holding stocks individually or through an investment vehicle. Stock position change was measured on a 1 (greatly reduced) to 7 (greatly increased) scale by using this question: “As of today, how much have you changed your position in stocks compared to the beginning of this year?” Respondents who answered less than four were categorized as reduced; respondents who answered more than four were categorized as increased; respondents who answered exactly four were categorized as no change.\n\nThe length of an expected U.S. economic recovery from the COVID‐19 pandemic was estimated with this question: “How long do you think it will take the U.S. economy to recover from COVID‐19 once restrictions are lifted?” Responses were coded as less than 12 months, 1–3 years, and longer than 3 years. Short‐term recession expectations were derived from this question: “How likely do you think that the U.S. economy will experience a recession in the next 12 months?” Possible responses consisted of not likely at all, somewhat likely, very likely, and not sure. Short‐term stock market expectations were estimated with this question: “What are your expectations that the stock market (or indices such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500) will be higher four weeks from now?” Possible responses included positive, negative, no change, and not sure. Last, respondents' preference for wearing a mask and social distancing was measured with this question: “Do you follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines for wearing a mask and social distancing?” Responses were yes, no, and prefer not to say.\n\nEconomic. Workforce status was coded as 1 for full‐ and part‐time workers, otherwise 0. Change in work force status was measured by comparing current labor force status and labor force status prior to the COVID‐19 pandemic, with a change coded as a 1, otherwise 0. Household income was coded with three income categories: less than or equal to $40,000, $40,001–$100,000, and greater than $100,000. Net worth was estimated with four categories: less than or equal to $0, $1–$99,999, $100,000–$249,000, and greater than $250,000. COVID‐19 EIP levels were estimated with four categories: less than $500, $500–$1,200, $1,201–$3,400, and more than $3,400.\n\nDemographic. Demographic variables included age, gender, race, education, household size, and marital status. Age was measured as a continuous variable. For gender, females were coded as a 1, with males coded as a 0. Whites were coded as a 1, with non‐Whites coded as a 0 for race. Respondents' highest level of education was estimated with three categories: high school, bachelor's degree, and graduate degree (master's or PhD). Household size was estimated by the number of household dependents and measured as a continuous variable. Married couples were coded as a 1; otherwise, 0.\n\n5 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS\nSample descriptive statistics are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for EIP allocation towards spending needs, spending wants, and financial transaction categories and subcategories. Most individuals used some portion of their EIP on spending needs (83%), with 55% spending some portion on wants, and 65% on financial transactions. Greater distinctions are drawn when comparing who used most or all (categorical level 4 or 5) of their EIP in certain areas, with 48% spending most or all on spending needs, but only 6% spending on wants, and 24% on financial transactions. Of those who allocated most or all of their EIP towards financial transactions, 35% used most or all for savings, 21% for debt, and only 6% for investing.\n\nTABLE 1.

Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to curtail the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West African COVID-19 data project a 67% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 46% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Additionally, disease elimination is possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 5 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic cases are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 8 days, only about 29% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures triggered a 33% reduction in the time-dependent effective reproduction number between February 28 and June 26, 2020. We conclude that curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic burden significantly in West Africa requires more control measures than those that have already been implemented, as well as more mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early.\n\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\nKeywords\nPublic health control measuresSARS-CoV-2 pandemicMathematical modelReproduction numberContact tracingAsymptomatic transmission\n1. Introduction\nA new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), that emerged from Wuhan, China is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic that is currently ravaging the world [1], [2], [3]. As of June , , about  confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections and 491,128 deaths were reported worldwide [4], [5], [6], [7]. Most of these reported COVID-19 cases (approximately ) and deaths (approximately 124,161 deaths) were from the United States of America. The epicenter of the pandemic is expected to shift to sub-Saharan Africa, which as of June ,  had reported about 170,843 confirmed cases and 1915 deaths. Of these, about 73,624 confirmed cases and 1352 deaths were from West Africa. The first confirmed West African case was in Nigeria on February 27,2020, i.e., approximately two months after the first case was officially announced in China [1]. The highest burden of the disease in West Africa by June ,  was in Nigeria (about 23,298 cases and  deaths) [5]. This is in line with a multilayered-risk assessment (based on nine risk factors) in [8] that identified Nigeria as the West African country with the highest COVID-19 risk. Another study by Martinez-Alvarez et al. [9] projected that some West African countries, e.g., Burkina Faso and Senegal might experience sharp increases in the number of COVID-19 cases that are similar to those observed in European countries in March and April, 2020.\n\nHumans can acquire the novel coronavirus when they come into contact with contaminated surfaces or from droplets released by infectious symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [10]. Mild to moderate infection symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, headache, muscle pain, and shortness of breath (or tachypnea in children). In severe cases, fever is associated with severe dyspnea, respiratory distress, and tachypnea [11]. Currently, there is no vaccine or widely accepted drug for COVID-19. Therefore, governments and individuals are forced to rely on public health preventive measures such as basic hygiene, travel or movement restrictions, social-distancing, wearing masks, etc. Current control measures being implemented in West Africa include regular hand washing with hydroalkolic solutions, quarantine of suspected cases, isolation of confirmed cases, social distancing (e.g., travel restrictions, school closures, and banning of gatherings involving more than 10 people), contact tracing, and testing and treating identified cases. Additionally, wearing of masks in public was recently recommended as another control measure in many countries in this region. Unfortunately, it is difficult to implement these basic public health measures effectively in some West African countries due to wide-spread poverty and poor investment in health care (staff, equipment, and infrastructure) [9]. For example, in thirteen of the sixteen West African countries, less than two medical doctors are allocated to every group of 10,000 inhabitants [9], [12]. In particular, only Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, and Cape Verde have  or more medical doctors per 10,000 inhabitants [12]. Another possible explanation for this low doctor to population ratio is alternative medicine (especially traditional medicine) that is widely practiced in the West African region. The World Health Organization estimates that about  of the population of West Africa rely on traditional medicine for their health care needs both in rural and urban areas [13]. On the other hand, the annual per capita spending on health for about half of the countries in the region (Gambia, Niger, Benin, Mali, Guinea, Togo, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania) is less than US$50. Only Cape Verde spends more than US$100 per capita, i.e., about  times below the average per capita health spending in countries like Italy and Spain–two European countries that experienced high COVID-19 burden [14]. As a result of poor investment in health care and health care systems, the region has been an epidemic hotspot for emerging and neglected tropical diseases including the Ebola virus (EBOV), Lassa virus (LASV), and Buruli ulcers in recent years [15], [16]. With such inadequate healthcare systems and personnel in the region, the impact of COVID-19 might be catastrophic. To compound matters, some countries in West Africa are still not well prepared to tackle this pandemic despite the observed devastating impacts and trend of the pandemic in the US, Europe, and Asia [9].\n\nThere is, therefore, the need to exploit every existing tool and/or develop new tools that can be useful in guiding public health decision-making in the fight against the pandemic. This includes developing and using new qualitative and quantitative methods such as mathematical models. There has been an influx of mathematical models to assess the impact of COVID-19 and to guide public health response in different cities, countries and regions of the world (see, for example,[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]). Few of these mathematical model frameworks have focused on the COVID-19 pandemic situation in West Africa as a whole. Among these few models, some have focused only on one or two countries, e.g. Nigeria and Ghana, while others have used basic regression or exponential growth models to analyze and predict disease trends[25], [26]. Martinez-Alvarez et al. [9] used a simple graph-plot based comparative analysis of observed COVID-19 data for the first 23 days of the pandemic to examine the future trajectory of the epidemic in six West African countries (Burkina Faso, Senegal, Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and The Gambia). This far, only one study has considered the entire region of West Africa [27]. In this study, a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression framework was used to predict the number of disease cases (2.8 million by June 30, 2020) and to assess the epidemiological, socio-economic and health system readiness of the region to the pandemic.\n\nIn this study, we develop a new susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR)-type mathematical model for COVID-19 in West Africa and use it to (i) study the current transmission pattern of COVID-19, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented public health control measures such contact tracing, social distancing and use of face masks on COVID-19 transmission, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West Africa. In addition to incorporating various basic public health control measures, our model accounts for asymptomatic infectious individuals – a class of individuals that render disease control more difficult since they do not exhibit clinical disease symptoms, although they contribute to disease transmission [21]. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has used an explicit SEIR-type compartmental model together with data for the West African pandemic period (from February 28, 2020 to June 26, 2020) to study the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the region, assess the impact of current control measures, and discuss further control measures that might be required to better control the pandemic in the region.\n\n2. Methods\n2.1. Model framework\nWe develop a deterministic -type model framework, where the total population () is subdivided in four categories: Susceptible (), Exposed (), Infectious asymptomatic (), infectious symptomatic (), infectious at treatment or isolation centers (), and Recovered (). That is, . The model accounts for public health control measures that lead to a reduction in the force of infection , such as social distancing and face mask use. Following the approach in Ngonghala et al. [17], we model the force of infection by the functional form , where  () is the disease transmission rate by individuals in the  class and  is the percentage reduction in disease transmission due to public health control measures such as social distancing and face masks use. Note that  implies that no public health control measure leading to a reduction in disease transmission is applied and that  implies that implemented public health control measures are efficient enough to stop disease transmission. After the average incubation period , a proportion  of the exposed population does not develop symptoms, i.e., joins the  compartment, while the remaining proportion () join the  class. Identification and isolation of infectious asymptomatic individuals, e.g., through contact tracing occurs at rate , i.e.,  is the average time it takes for an infectious asymptomatic individual to be identified and isolated. Isolation or hospitalization of symptomatic cases occurs at rate , i.e.,  is the average time it takes for an infectious symptomatic individual to be isolated. Humans from the , and  classes recover at rates , and , respectively, while individuals in the  and  classes die due to COVID-19 at respective rates  and . Using the flow diagram Fig. 1 and above description we obtain the following system of equations:\n\n(2.1)\nwhere  is the actively mixing population, i.e., . Since individuals in the  class are in some form of confinement or isolation, we assume that they are not part of the actively mixing population and so they do not contribute in disease transmission. We denote the initial conditions of the model (2.1) by , , , , , , where for the pandemic to take off, at least one of the infected populations must be greater zero.\n\n\nDownload : Download high-res image (125KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 1. Flow-chart of COVID-19 model showing the flow of humans between different compartments. The susceptible population is denoted by , the exposed population is denoted by , the infectious asymptomatic population is denoted by , the infectious symptomatic population is denoted by , the isolated infectious population is denoted by , and the recovered population is denoted by . The parameters of the model are described in the text.\n\n2.2. West African COVID-19 data and parameter estimation\nWest Africa comprises sixteen countries: Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cape Verde, Ghana, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau and Gambia. Based on the latest United Nations estimates, the current population of West Africa is , i.e., about  of the world population [28]. The region includes nine of the 25 poorest countries in the world [29]. Application of basic public health control measures against COVID-19 spread in most West African countries started on March , , i.e., about  days after the outbreak in the region. The data considered for this analysis spans the period from February 28, 2020, i.e., one day after the first case until June 26, 2020. In West Africa, the reported confirmed cases are infectious symptomatic individuals who have been tested at a treatment center or infectious asymptomatic individuals who have been detected through contact-tracing or systematic testing on target groups and then tested at a treatment center. Hence, we assume that confirmed disease cases correspond to individuals isolated infectious individuals in isolation or at treatment centers ().\n\nWe use the cumulative number of cases in West Africa, downloaded from the Global Rise of Education website [30] to fit our model and estimate some of the key parameters presented in Table 1. The fitting that was carried out using a nonlinear least squares method in MATLAB version (R2017a) involved finding the best set of parameter values that minimizes the root mean square differences between the observed cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases in West Africa and the predicted cumulative COVID-19 cases from our model (2.1). The minimization was achieved through the built-in constraint minimization algorithm “fmincon” in MATLAB. We repeated this procedure 1000 times for each of the parameters and used the normal distribution to compute the mean values of the parameters together with a  confidence interval (CI). The goodness of fit of our model assessed using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was 188.45. The fitted and known parameter values are presented in Table 1 and the model fit is illustrated in Fig. 2(a). It is worth noting that the choice of parameters to estimate from the data or to extract from the literature was motivated by its importance to the transmission dynamics of the disease. A plot of the observed confirmed daily cases and the predicted daily cases from system (2.1) using the fitted and known parameters is presented in Fig. 2(b), while an extended plot of the new daily cases illustrating when the West African pandemic might peak (October 06, 2020) and the corresponding number of new cases (14,250) is depicted in Fig. 2(c).\n\nTable 1.

Results\n3.1. Analytical results (reproduction number and final size relation)\nIn this section, we derive the basic reproduction number of the model, which is defined as the average number of new infections generated by a typical infectious individual introduced in a population where everybody is susceptible [35]. For endemic models, i.e., models with vital dynamics (births and narural deaths), the basic reproduction number denoted by  provides a condition under which a disease can invade a population (when ), or can be contained (when ), while for epidemic models like the one in this study, it serves as a threshold for determining whether the disease under consideration will spread. Using the next generation matrix approach in [35], [36], the basic reproduction number is:\n(3.1)\nwhere\nObserve from Eq. (3.1) that the reproduction number , is the sum of two components, which represent the contribution of the infectious asymptomatic class  and the infectious symptomatic class . For system (2.1) that already include some control efforts, the control reproduction number , is given by . The approach in[35], [36] also assures us that the family of disease-free equilibrium  of system (2.1) is locally and asymptotically stable whenever the reproduction number  is less than one. Another useful quantity that is associated with the reproduction number is the time-dependent effective reproduction number, which for model (2.1) is given by . It is worth mentioning that the epidemic grows when the effective reproduction number is greater than unity, peaks when the effective reproduction number equals unity and declines when the effective reproduction number is below unity. To derive the threshold reduction in the disease transmission , required to reduce the control reproduction number to one, we set , i.e.,  in Eq. (3.1) and solve for . This yields:\n(3.2)\nNote that the fraction in the right hand side of the threshold value  of  is greater than zero and less than or equal to one since . Note also that , which corresponds to the case in which  now serves as a threshold for an outbreak or the disease dying out. In particular, disease elimination is possible if  (since ). If , which corresponds to , the infected population increases, attains a peak, and declines to zero as . In particular, the pandemic peaks when the effective reproduction number is one. The epidemiological implication of this is that massive adherence to control measures that reduce COVID-19 transmission, e.g., social distancing can lead to disease elimination, while low adherence to such measures will reduce disease burden, but might not lead to elimination soon enough. To compute the final size relation, we follow the method in [37]. In addition to the final size relation calculation, this approach provides an alternative method for calculating the basic reproduction number of the model (2.1). To apply the method, we first identify the vector  of COVID-19 infections, i.e., . Then, we identify the vectors  and  of the susceptible and recovered classes, respectively, i.e.,  and . With this notation, the system (2.1) can now be expressed in the compact form:\n(3.3)\nwhere  is a row vector consisting of the proportions of susceptible individuals who progress to specific infected classes upon infection,  is a diagonal matrix with leading diagonal elements the relative susceptibilities of individuals in the susceptible classes,  is the force of infection, i.e., ,  is a row vector of relative horizontal transmissions,  is a transition matrix (as in the next generation matrix approach), and  is vector of recovery rates. For Model (2.1), , , and  is the transition matrix\n\nBy Theorem 2.1 of [37], the basic reproduction number is\nand by Theorem 5.1 of [37], the basic reproduction number is given by\n, and . This final size relation can be used to approximate the number of individuals who remain uninfected, and consequently the number of individuals who were infected during the pandemic.\n\n3.2. Numerical simulation results\n3.2.1. Current patterns of COVID-19 transmission\nIn this section, we use the parameters presented in Table 1 to simulate system (2.1) and to investigate the impact of control measures on key model outputs such as the control and effective reproduction numbers  and , respectively. The basic reproduction number , and the control reproduction number  computed using this baseline parameter regime in Table 1 are 1.854 () and 1.37 (), respectively. The control reproduction number corresponds to an approximately  reduction in the basic reproduction number due to implemented control measures. This calls for more effective control measures to limit the spread of the disease. All simulations were carried out using the computational software MATLAB (version R2017a). When it was necessary to solve the system of ordinary differential equations (2.1) we used the inbuilt MATLAB function “”.\n\n\nDownload : Download high-res image (367KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 3. Impact of control measures assessed through a reduction in the disease transmission rates on the control reproduction number, the effective reproduction number, and the epidemic peak.

(b) Evolution of the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in West Africa for different values of . (c) Prediction and sensitivity of COVID-19 peak date and size to different values of . The initial conditions and parameters are presented in Table 1.\n\n3.3. Impact of control measures in West Africa\nThe first analysis involves evaluating the impact of the percentage reduction in the effective contact rates due to the implementation of public health control measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, the use of masks in public, washing of hands, etc., denoted by  on the control and effective reproduction numbers, as well as the pandemic peak and the time to peak. Here, we fixed all the parameters at the baseline values provided in Table 1 and varied only the parameter . Changes in the control reproduction number as a function of , depicted in Fig. 3 show that about  reduction in the disease transmission is required to reduce  to one and possibly bring the pandemic under control. This value () corresponds to the numerical value of  from Eq. (3.2) computed using the baseline parameter values from Table 1 and a  increase from the baseline value of . Furthermore, our results show that there will be a  reduction in the effective reproduction number by July 01, 2020 if no control measures are applied and a  reduction by the same date if there is a  reduction in disease transmission, i.e., an additional reduction of  in  (Fig. 3(b)).\n\nWe also simulated the system (2.1) to explore the impact of public health control measures on the timing and size of the pandemic peak in West Africa (Fig. 3(c). The results of our simulations show that in the absence of any control measure that results in a reduction in the effective transmission rates, i.e., if , the COVID-19 pandemic in West Africa will peak by July ,  with about 44,350 people infected on the day of the peak (red curve in Fig. 3(c)). It is worth noting that this is the worst case scenario. Applying control measures at the baseline level, i.e.,   will bring about a  reduction in the number of cases (from 44,350 in the worst case scenario to 14,780 at the baseline control measures) when the pandemic peaks and also delay the peak to October ,  (blue curve in Fig. 3(c)). Improved control measures resulting in  and  reduction in disease transmission, will lead to reductions of  and , respectively, in the number of daily confirmed cases when the epidemic attains its peak (black and magenta curves in Fig. 3(c)). Thus, improved control measures that are related to reducing disease transmission have a significant effect in reducing the number of cases and flattening the epidemic curve—an outcome that will prevent the already fragile health care systems in West Africa from being overwhelmed by a high COVID-19 burden.\n\nOther basic public health control measures include isolating symptomatic infectious humans and contact tracing and isolating asymptomatic humans. In our model we assume that isolating symptomatic infectious humans is at rate  and contact tracing and systematic testing and isolating asymptomatic infectious humans is at rate . Heat maps were plotted to investigate the individual and combined effects of pairs of control measures such as contact tracing, isolation, and using control measures that lead to a reduction in disease transmission, e.g., lockdowns, social and physical distancing, mask use, etc., on COVID-19 in West Africa (Fig. 4). Our analyses show that the spread of the disease decreases with a higher reduction in the disease transmission rate and a decreasing proportion of exposed humans who do not develop clinical disease symptoms (i.e., become asymptomatic) after the incubation period,  (Fig. 4(a)). Thus, if a higher proportion of exposed humans do not develop clinical disease symptoms after the incubation period, a higher reduction in the disease transmission rate will be required to eliminate the disease. In particular, if half of the exposed individuals develop symptoms at the end of the incubation period, i.e.,  , then only a  reduction in the disease transmission rate is required to eliminate the disease. But, if  of the exposed become asymptomatic after the incubation period, then a  reduction in the disease transmission rate is required to eliminate the disease (Fig. 4(a)). The combined impact of detection and isolation of asymptomatic humans (by contact tracing or mass testing) together with a reduction in the disease transmission rate is explored in Fig. 4(b). If asymptomatic individuals are detected and isolated fast enough, e.g., within  days, i.e.,  , then a  reduction in the disease transmission rate would suffice for elimination, while if it takes a long time to detect and isolate asymptomatic individuals, e.g., within  days, a  reduction on the disease transmission rate is required to contain the pandemic in West Africa (Fig. 4(b)). In particular, we found out that disease elimination is possible even if detection and isolation of asymptomatic humans is not complemented with any additional measure (maintaining ). But such identification and isolation must occur in a timely manner, e.g., within  days, i.e.,  (Fig. 4(b)). If only  of humans fail to develop symptoms at the end of the incubation period, then asymptomatic humans must be identified and isolated within  days for disease elimination to be possible (Fig. 4(e)). Thus, disease control is more difficult if it takes long to contact trace and isolate asymptomatic humans.\n\nOur results also show that timely isolation of symptomatic cases is important in reducing the disease burden in West Africa but not enough as asymptomatic isolation do, although disease elimination is only possible if isolation of infectious symptomatic cases is complemented with another control measure (Fig. 4(c), (d)). In particular, if symptomatic humans are identified and isolated within  days, i.e., , then a  reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination, while if it takes a long time to isolate symptomatic infectious individuals, e.g., within  days (i.e., ), a  reduction on the disease transmission rate is required to contain the pandemic in West Africa (Fig. 4(c)). When isolation of symptomatic infectious disease cases is complemented with identification and isolation of asymptomatic infectious cases, disease elimination is only possible through timely identification and isolation of asymptomatic cases (Fig. 4(d)). Thus, identifying and isolating asymptomatic individuals in a timely manner contributes more in curtailing the pandemic in West Africa than isolating symptomatic infectious individuals. Furthermore, if more exposed humans develop disease symptoms at the end of the incubation period and more symptomatic infectious individuals are identified and isolated in a timely manner, disease elimination is possible (Fig. 4(f)). In particular, if  of exposed humans develop clinical disease symptoms at the end of the incubation period (i.e. , then symptomatic infectious humans must be isolated within  days in order to eliminate the disease.\n\n\nDownload : Download high-res image (605KB)Download : Download full-size image\nFig. 4.

Discussion\nMathematical models have been useful in understanding disease-outbreaks and in informing policy aimed at curtailing such diseases in a timely manner [17], [18], [19], [23], [24], [38]. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that is currently spreading around the world, mathematical models have been very useful in predicting the course of the disease and in assessing the impacts of basic public health control measures[17], [18], [19], [23], [39]. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to inform the COVID-19 trend and possible course of control measures in West Africa. The model is trained with COVID-19 data from West Africa for the period from February 28, 2020 to June 26, 2020, and used to compute the reproduction number, as well as to assess the impact of basic public health control measures on the disease.\n\nWe obtained a basic reproduction number of   1.854 (CI  ), which is relatively low compared to values recently reported for two West African countries—Nigeria (2.29) and Senegal (2.36) [40]. Also, a basic reproduction number of 2.083 (CI  ) was reported for India in [41]. The control reproduction number obtained for West Africa was   1.37 (CI: ], which is close to the value reported for South Korea (1.5) [42] but lower than the value reported for Wuhan one week before travel restrictions were introduced (2.35) [43]. Hence, although the disease is still spreading () in West Africa, the spread is slow compared to other parts of world. This low transmission in the region can be attributed to the fact that there is limited movement of individuals within the region and between the region and the rest of the world [8]. Furthermore, the low number of confirmed cases in West Africa might result from under-reporting of cases as was the case in Peru [44]. This is supported by the growing number of asymptomatic infectious individuals observed in our study. De Leon et al. [21] observed a similar trend in Mexico, where over  of the infectious population was asymptomatic [21]. In the absence of sufficient tes",

The economic impact is expected to be large and can lead to a global recession. Millions of people will  be  pushed  into  poverty. In  this  paper,  we  estimate  the  impact of  COVID-19 on  poverty in Indonesia. One projection puts 1.2 million people in the country would eventually be infected. The economic impact is also expected to be severe. Compared to the baseline projection of 5 percent economic  growth  in  2020,  various  studies  estimate  that  COVID-19  would  reduce  Indonesia’s economic growth to between 1 and 4 percent. We find that under the mildest COVID-19 impact on economic growth, the poverty rate will increase from 9.2 percent in September 2019 to 9.7 percent by the end of 2020. This implies that 1.3 million more people will be  pushed into poverty. Under the most severe projection, the poverty rate will increase to 12.4 percent, implying 8.5 million more people will become poor. The latter means that Indonesia’s progress in reducing poverty over the last decade would be wiped out. The implication of this is that Indonesia needs to expand its social protection programs to assists the new poor in addition to the existing poor.

INTRODUCTION   The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first erupted in China in December 2019. By April 2020, close to 1.5 million people all over the world have been infected (Johns Hopkins University, 2020). While making global projections is challenging (de Walque, 2020), widely cited results from Walker et  al.  (2020) put  estimated  global  deaths to  range  from  40 million  people  under no  mitigation scenario  to  2  million  people  under  the  most  successful  suppression  scenario  that  reduced interpersonal contact rates by 75 percent.  The economic impact of COVID-19 starts as a negative supply shock (Hausmann, 2020). Two things occur. First, workers get infected, reducing production capacity. Atkeson (2020) states that when 10 percent of the  population  are  infected, key  financial and economic infrastructure would face severe  staffing  shortages.  Second,  restrictions  of  activity  that  is  needed  as  part  of  disease suppression. As mentioned before, as high as 75 percent reduction in interpersonal contact could be needed to bring COVID-19 under control.   Eventually, these would lead to a demand shock. In countries with incomplete markets and liquidity constrained consumers, the initial supply shock could lead to amplified demand shocks (Guerrieri et  al.,  2020).  Modelling  by  Eichenbaum,  Rebelo,  and  Trabandt  (2020)  shows  that  disease suppression policies  would  save lives  but  exacerbate the  size  of economic  recession.  Long-term effects could include unemployment hysteresis effects and destruction of supply-side chains.  An economic recession would push millions of people into poverty. A rapid simulation covering 138 developing and 26 high-income economies finds that even in the mildest scenario, COVID-19 could impoverish an additional 85 million people (Sumner, Hoy, and Ortiz-Juarez, 2020).   In  this  paper,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  poverty  in  Indonesia.  The country  first announced its first two COVID-19 infections in early March 2020. Within one month, the number of infected people has reached close to 3,000, with an 8 percent case fatality rate. Under the most recent projection, 1.2 million people in the country would  eventually  be  infected  (Shidiq,  2020). Economic  impacts  would  be  severe.  Compared  to the  baseline  projection  of  5  percent  annual growth in 2020, various studies estimate that COVID-19 would reduce Indonesia’s economic growth rate to between 1 and 4 percent.      We first estimate the growth elasticity of household expenditure based on long time series data of economic growth and average household expenditure. Then we distribute the aggregate household expenditure shock into shock in each expenditure percentile using the pattern from an episode of poverty-increasing economic-downturn in Indonesia. We use the resulting household expenditure distribution to measure the projected poverty rate. We do the simulations based on various growth impact projections of COVID-19. We find that under the mildest COVID-19 impact on growth, 1.3 million more  people  will be  pushed  into  poverty.  Under  the  most  severe projection, 8.5  million more people will become poor, wiping out the progress in reducing poverty over the last decade.   The rest of this paper  proceeds  as  follows.  The  next section  describes  the  estimation  method  in greater detail.  Section III presents and discusses the estimation results. Section IV concludes and provides some policy implications.    \n  2 The SMERU Research Institute II.  ESTIMATION METHOD AND DATA   Estimating the impact of a shock, including COVID-19, on poverty requires to forecast the impact across  the  distribution  of  household  income  or  expenditure.  This  distributional  impact  can  be assumed, based on theory, borrowed from another context, or applying a historical pattern. In the past two decades, Indonesia experienced two occasions when a shock was large enough to cause the poverty rate to increase. The first was in 1997−1998 due to the Asian financial crisis. The second was in 2005−2006 due a large increase in fuel price, exacerbated by an increase in rice price (World Bank, 2006). This study applies the  2005−2006 pattern  to  measure  the  2019−2020  distributional impact on household expenditure due to COVID-19.    2.1 The Impact of a Shock on Poverty: The 2005−2006 Experience   In the second half of 2005, due to the pressure from continuously increasing international oil price, the  Government  of  Indonesia  had  no  choice  but  to increase  the  domestic  prices of  fuels  by  an average of 125 percent in October of that year (Sen and Steer, 2005). Back then, fuel prices were fixed  by  the government,  with  the gaps  with  international  oil  price  automatically covered  by a government subsidy. When the international oil price increased substantially in 2005, the pressure on government budget became unbearable, forcing the government to increase the domestic fuel prices.   Table 1 summarizes the impact of the shock on Indonesian economy. Annual economic growth was only little impacted, declining from 5.7 percent in 2005 to 5.5 percent in 2007. However, it masked the more significant  impact in  the  economy as shown by the  quarterly  economic  growth,  which declined from 6.3  percent in the first quarter of 2005 to 4.6 percent in the  first quarter of 2006. Figure 1 on the trend of quarterly economic growth shows this more clearly.   Table 1. Economic Growth, Household Expenditure, and Poverty Rate  in 2005 and 2006  2005 2006 Change Economic growth (%) 5.7 5.5 -0.2 Economic growth Q1 year-on-year (%) 6.3 4.6 -1.7 Average per capita household expenditure (Rp) 265,368 249,326 -16,042 (-6%) Poverty rate (%) 15.97 17.75 1.78   \n     3 The SMERU Research Institute  Figure 1. Quarterly economic growth 2005–2006 (year on year)  Because  the  National  Socioeconomic  Survey  (Susenas),  which  collects  data  on  household expenditure and is used to measure poverty, is fielded in March every year, the impacts of the shock on  household  expenditure  and  poverty  were  also  quite  significant.  The  average  per  capita household expenditure dropped  by  about  six percent, while the  poverty  rate  increased from 16 percent in 2005 to 17.8 percent in 2006 (BPS, 2007).   Figure 2 shows that the six percent decline in average per capita household expenditure was not evenly distributed  across  the distribution  of  per capita  household  expenditure. The  decline  was proportionally  much  higher  at  the  bottom  of  the  distribution  compared  to  the  top  of  the distribution. While the poorest 10 percent population suffered from 10−12 percent decline in their per capita household expenditure, the richest 10 percent population only experienced 0−3 percent decline in their per capita household expenditure. This positively sloped distributional impact of the shock explains the significant increase in poverty rate.    Figure 2.

First, through a combination of supply and demand shocks, COVID-19 outbreak causes a decline in economic activities, which leads to a decline in economic growth. This macroeconomic shock causes a decline in average per capita expenditure at household level. Then depending on its distributional impact, the decline in per capita household expenditure may lead to an increase in the incidence of poverty.    Figure 3. Transmission mechanism from COVID-19 to poverty incidence   The  impact  of  COVID-19  on  declining  economic  growth  has  already  been  projected  by  various institutions (see  Section  III). Therefore, in  this  paper we focus  on  estimating how  the  decline in economic growth will affect poverty incidence. In the first step, we estimate the growth elasticity of average per capita household expenditure based on long time series data of economic growth and household expenditure. In the second step, we then translate the resulting shock in aggregate household expenditure into shock in each percentile of per capita household expenditure using the pattern from the economic downturn in 2005−2006 in Figure 2. Finally, in the third step, we use the resulting per capita household expenditure distribution to measure the projected poverty rate. We implement these  simulations based on various growth impact projections of COVID-19 proposed by various institutions.    2.3 From Growth Shock to Household Expenditure Shock   Poverty  in  Indonesia  is  measured  based  on  household  expenditure.  Therefore,  we  must  first translate the shock in economic growth into the shock in average per capita household expenditure. This can  be  achieved by estimating the correlation between the change in  economic growth and the  change  in  average  per  capita  household  expenditure.  The  correlation  can  be  obtained  by estimating the following model:         (1)  where   is  change  in  log  of  average  per  capita  household  expenditure  and   is change in the rate of economic growth, while  is the correlation parameter to be estimated. The \n     5 The SMERU Research Institute model  can  be  estimated  using  time  series  data  of  economic  growth  and  average  per  capita household expenditure.   Once the  correlation has been estimated, the next step is  to  estimate the decline in  average per capita household expenditure between 2019 and 2020. This is obtained by applying the estimated correlation to estimate the decline in average per capita household expenditure between 2019 and 2020 based on the scenarios of decline in economic growth back to the model:              - )  (2)  The result shows how much average per capita household expenditure will decline for each scenario of projected economic growth in 2020.    2.4 The Distributional Impact of Expenditure Shock   Once the decline in average per capita household expenditure has been estimated, the next step is to  estimate  how  this  expenditure  shock  will  affect  the  distribution  of  per  capita  household expenditure  in  2020.  To  estimate  this,  the  pattern  of  distributional  impact  of  the  2005−2006 expenditure shock in Figure 2 will be used and applied to the 2019−2020 expenditure shock. The first step to do this is to calculate the decline in per capita household expenditure by percentile for every one percent decline in average per capita household expenditure. This is obtained by dividing the  proportional  decline  in real  per  capita  household  expenditure in  Figure  2 by  the decline  in average per capita household expenditure. The results are shown in Figure 4, which has a negative slope, confirming a larger impact at the lower end of the distribution.    Figure 4. Change of per capita household expenditure (PCE) per one-percent change in average PCE by percentile of PCE, 2005−2006     00.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.82010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100RatioPercentile of PCE\n  6 The SMERU Research Institute Assuming this pattern of distributional impact of expenditure shock holds in 2019−2020, it is then applied  to  the  decline  in  average  per  capita  household  expenditure  between  2019  and  2020 estimated through Equation (2) to obtain the distribution of  per capita household expenditure in 2020 in constant 2019 prices. Since the 2020 expenditure is measured using the 2019 prices, the 2020 poverty lines are the same as the 2019 poverty lines. Using these poverty lines, the poverty rate in 2020 can now be calculated.    2.5 Data   The  main  data  set  that  is  used  in  this  study  is  the  National  Socioeconomic  Survey  (Susenas), collected  by  Statistics  Indonesia  (Badan  Pusat  Statistik,  BPS).  Susenas  collects  data  related  to household welfare indicator, such as  household  expenditures,  as  well  as basic demographic and other  characteristics  of  households  and  their  members.  BPS  uses  Susenas  data  to  calculate Indonesia’s official poverty statistics at national, provincial, and district levels.   First, since we benchmark our simulations to the 2005−2006 shock, we use the longitudinal Susenas Panel 2005 and 2006 data sets to calculate the change in household expenditure distribution. The Susenas Panel 2005 and 2006 data has a sample of 10,500 households and was used to calculate the official national poverty rates for the respected years.   Second,  we  utilize  the  Susenas  March  2019  data  to  simulate  the  household  expenditure  and calculate the poverty rate for 2020. Susenas March 2019 has a sample of 315,000 households. Third, to estimate the correlation of GDP to household expenditure in Equation (1), we collect the data of average per capita household expenditure, also from Susenas, and GDP data as well as its growth for the period of 1980−2019. This data is also obtained from BPS.     III. ESTIMATION RESULTS    Using the method  developed above  and  available  data, we estimate the poverty implications of various economic growth scenarios due to COVID-19 proposed by various institutions. We use the official poverty rate of 9.22 percent in September 2019 as the baseline. This means that the poverty rate scenarios estimated here refer to the period of end of 2020 or early 2021.    3.1 The Correlation of Income and Expenditure Shocks   Table  2  shows the  estimation  results  of  Equation (1)  on  the correlation of  change  in  economic growth and change in average per capita household expenditure using time series data from 1980 to 2019. The coefficient indicates that one percentage point increase in economic growth correlates with  1.4  percent  increase  in  average  per  capita  household  expenditure  and  vice  versa.  This estimated correlation will be applied to Equation (2) to estimate the change in average per capita household expenditure between 2019 and 2020 based on economic growth projections proposed by various institutions.     \n     7 The SMERU Research Institute Table 2.

All  institutions  predict  a  slower  growth  in  2020  compared  to  2019.  The Economist Intelligence Unit  (2020)  and  Yusuf  (2020)  predict  lower  growth  than others,  of  only  1 and 1.2 percent respectively. The World Bank (2020) estimates a moderate growth of 2.1 percent, although it also presents a worst-case scenario of -3.5 percent. Meanwhile, Rogers (2020) and Bank Indonesia (2020) predict the most optimistic growth scenarios at 3 and 4.2 percent respectively. In addition, the Minister of Finance of Indonesia has been quoted to say that the worst estimation of economic growth in 2020 could be as low as -0.4 percent (Finance Detik, 2020).    Figure 5. Economic growth projections for 2020−2023 (%) (growth in 2019 is actual growth as the baseline)  Based on those economic growth scenarios and the estimated correlation coefficient in Table 2, we estimate  the  impact  of COVID-19  on  the  change  in  average  per  capita  household  expenditure between 2019 and 2020. Table 3 shows the estimation results.

The  results  are  shown  in Figure 6. This figure shows  the  distributional impact  in  per capita household expenditure of  various growth projections  in  2020. Reflecting the method, the pattern of per capita household expenditure change in 2019−2020 mimics the 2005−2006 pattern but with different magnitudes. When economic growth is only 1 percent, the poorest population will experience a decrease in  their  per capita household expenditure by  as  much as 10  percent. Meanwhile,  when  economic  growth  is  projected  to  only  slightly  decrease  to  4.2  percent,  the poorest population’s  per capita  household  expenditure will  only slightly  decrease by  2  percent. Nevertheless, the results of all simulations indicate that the poor is always relatively more affected by the shock compared to those in the higher parts of the distribution.    Figure 6.

Currently poverty statistics in Indonesia are calculated twice every year in the month of March and September. The latest poverty rate released by BPS is 9.22 percent for September 2019. The poverty rate is calculated by BPS using separate poverty lines for urban and rural areas in each province, totaling 67 poverty lines. Since September 2019 is quite close to COVID-19  outbreak  in  December  2019,  we  will  use  the  September  2019  poverty  rate  as  the baseline.   Unfortunately, the latest Susenas  dataset  available  is only for  March  2019. The  poverty rate for March 2019 is 9.41 percent. Hence, we need to calibrate the poverty condition in Susenas March 2019  dataset  to  reflect  the  September  2019 condition.  To  do  this,  we  multiply  the  population weight of Susenas March 2019 dataset by the ratio of poverty rate in September 2019 and poverty rate in March 2019.   Now the per capita household expenditure distribution in Susenas March 2019 dataset with new weight reflects the per capita household expenditure distribution in September 2019 in March 2019 prices. Hence, when the poverty rate is recalculated using Susenas March 2019 dataset with new weight and the original poverty lines, the result is 9.22 percent poverty rate, which is the poverty rate in September 2019.   To calculate the poverty incidence in 2020, first we estimate per capita household expenditure in 2020  by  applying the  distributional  change in  Figure  6 to  the per  capita  household  expenditure distribution in 2019. Using the 2020 poverty lines, which are the same as the March 2019 poverty lines because the 2020 household expenditure is measured using March 2019 constant prices, we then calculate the poverty rate in 2020.  Figure 7 shows the results on poverty rate projections for various economic growth projections in 2020. The baseline poverty rate before the COVID-19 outbreak in September 2019 is 9.22 percent, which  indicates  that  24.8  million  people  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Figure  7  shows  that  as economic growth becomes slower, the poverty rate will increase. When growth in 2020 is projected at 4.2 or 3 percent, the poverty rate will increase to 9.7 and 10.7 percent respectively. Meanwhile, when economic growth in 2020 is projected to be as slow as 2.1, 1.2, and 1 percent, the  poverty rate will jump to 11.4, 12.2, and 12.4 percent respectively.   \n  10 The SMERU Research Institute  Figure 7. Projected impact of COVID-19 outbreak on poverty rate and number of poor people  Finally, Figure 8 shows the change in poverty rate and number of poor people implied by Figure 7. For the 4.2 and 3 percent of economic growth projections, the poverty rate increases by 0.48 and 1.44  percentage  points  respectively,  implying  1.3  and  3.9  million  of  additional  poor  people respectively. Meanwhile, when economic growth in 2020 is projected at 2.1, 1.2, and 1 percent, the poverty rate will increase by 2.2, 3, and 3.1 percentage points respectively, implying 5.9, 8, and 8.5 million more people who become poor.

CONCLUSION    COVID-19 has  infected around 1.5 million people  all over the world by April 2020.  The economic impact of this is expected to be large, indicated by a significant decline in projected global economic growth in  2020. Economies are projected to  enter a recession. Along with  recessions, millions of people will become poor.   In this paper, we estimate the  impact of  COVID-19  on  poverty  in  Indonesia.  One  projection  puts that 1.2  million people in the  country would eventually be infected. The economic impact is also expected to be severe. Compared to the baseline projection of 5 percent economic growth in 2020, various  studies  estimate  that  COVID-19  would  reduce  Indonesia’s  economic  growth  rate  to between 1 and 4 percent.      To  estimate  the impact  of  this on  poverty,  we  conduct simulations  based  on various  economic growth  scenarios.  We  find  that  under the  mildest  COVID-19  impact on  economic  growth,  the poverty rate will increase from 9.2 percent in September 2019 to 9.7 percent by the end of 2020. This  implies  that  1.3  million more  people will  be pushed  into  poverty.  Under  the  most  severe projection, the  poverty  rate will  increase  to 12.4  percent,  implying 8.5 million  more  people will become poor.   The implication of this is that Indonesia needs to put in place social protection programs to assists the new poor in  addition to the existing poor. Given the scale of the problem, the resources that will  be  required  to  prepare  for  this  will  be  large.  To  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  these  social protection programs, Indonesia needs to learn from the similar programs during the past crises as well as from other countries.",

This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.\n\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\nKeywords\nCoronavirusQuarantineDepressionAnxietyPosttraumatic stress disease\n1. Introduction\nThe situation of alarm generated by Covid-19 has turned into a crisis with unprecedented consequences throughout the world. The impact of the pandemic and quarantine measures adopted concerning our mental health is evident, however, there are few large-scale studies containing significant evidence to explain their effects in areas where the outbreak has been more recent such as Europe.\n\nBrooks et al. (2020) in a recent review reported that quarantine is associated with increased psychological distress, diagnostic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and in general greater levels of stress. Regarding the current situation, a novel review and meta-analysis of the impact of the pandemic on our mental health, with 13 studies only carried out in Asian countries, indicated that anxiety and depression are often more than 20% prevalent (Pappa et al., 2020), with differences in gender and occupation.\n\nWhen the present study was completed on 28 March 2020 in Spain, the alarm situation had already been in place for two weeks. According to official sources at the time of the study Spain presented a total of 72,248 positive results for Covid-19, and 5690 deaths, being the fourth country with the most infections from the pandemic and the second country with the highest number of deaths in the world. This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population three weeks after the outbreak of the pandemic and declaration of the alarm state.\n\n2. Methods\n2.1. Design\nA survey was developed to be completed online. The evaluation contained 80 questions and the average time for completion was about 7 min. The consent form to participate in the study and acceptance of the data protection laws was included. The study was also approved by the Deontological Commission of the Complutense University of Madrid with the reference “pr_2019_20_029“. The survey was launched on 21 March and data was collected until 28 March 2020.\n\n2.2. Participants\nParticipants were recruited by sending the survey through various social network channels. The final sample, obtained through the snowball method, had 3480 people, made up of the general population and various specific groups. Inclusion criteria were: 1. To be over 18 years of age; 2. To be living in Spain during the health alarm situation derived from Covid-19.\n\n2.3. Variables and instruments\nThe variables and instruments included in the assessment were the following:\n\nSociodemographic variables and variables related to Covid-19 were collected through questions developed ad hoc.\n\nPsychological impact: possible symptomatology was measured using the following screening instruments: Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) (Kroenke et al., 2009, Diez-Quevedo et al., 2001). Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 (GAD-2) (Spitzer et al., 2006, Garcia-Campayo et al., 2014). Civilian version of the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Reduced version (PCL-C-2) (Lang and Stein, 2005, Weathers et al., 1993). The PHQ-2 and the GAD-2 are brief self-report screening questionnaires that address the frequency of depressive symptoms and anxiety. They consist of 2 Likert-type questions ranging from 0 to 3. The PCL-C-2 was used to detect the presence of certain phenomena related to traumatic experience. The Likert-answers range from 0 to 4.\n\nDiscrimination: Day-to-Day Discrimination Index (InDI-D) (Scheim and Bauer, 2019). We used the main scale formed by 9 Likert-type items with four response options (1–4). The different questions evaluated the presence of intersectional discrimination from the beginning of the alarm situation.\n\nLoneliness: 3-item version of the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3) (Russell, 1996), Spanish version (Velarde-Mayol et al., 2016). Three items in Likert-type format with three response options.\n\nSocial support: Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (EMAS) (Zimet et al., 1988), adapted to Spanish (Landeta and Calvete, 2002). The scale has 12 Likert-type items with 7 response alternatives (1–7).\n\nSpiritual well-being: evaluated through the Spanish version of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp12) (Cella et al., 1998). The answers were Likert-type from (0–4).\n\nSelf-Compassion Scale (SCS) (Neff, 2003) Spanish version (Garcia-Campayo et al., 2014) evaluating how the subject usually acts towards himself in difficult moments in different dimensions. The items are Likert type (1–5).\n\nSense of belonging: was evaluated by means of four Likert-type items (1–4) previously used in other studies (Hernan and Rodriguez, 2017). These questions included membership of different groups.\n\n2.4. Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were calculated. The relationships between each variable and symptomatology measures were reported as a univariate R2 value and standardized coefficients, B(std). In addition, linear regression models were calculated for each psychological impact variable. Models were estimated by Least Squares and built with a theory-driven forward strategy (testing the R2 increase). The statistical analysis was performed using R (3.6.3).\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Psychological impact\nThe scores on the PHQ-2 depression scale averaged 1.60 (SD = 1.50) with 18.7% of the sample exceeding the cut-off point on the scale for detecting a possible case of depressive disorder. In anxiety, the GAD-2 reported mean scores of 1.79 (SD = 1.63), with 21.6% of the sample exceeding the cut-off point. Finally, with regard to post-traumatic symptoms, the PCl-C-2 presented a mean score of 1.84 (SD = 1.42), with 15.8% of the sample having scores that revealed the presence of moderate to extreme post-traumatic symptoms.\n\n3.2. Sociodemographic data and psychological impact\nThe sample (N = 3480) had a majority of women (75%), with university or postgraduate studies (67%). The average age was 37.92, reflecting a majority of persons aged between 18 and 39 years old (56.63%), and a minority of persons in the 59–80-year-old group (6.81%), where the average age was also 64.85.\n\nBeing older was significantly negatively related to depression, anxiety and PSTD, compared to the younger age group. Being female had a positive relationship with all three symptomatology variables.\n\n3.3. Covid-19 related data and psychological impact\nIn relation to Covid-19, 13.9% of the sample declared that they had suffered symptoms compatible with the disease, while only, 7% had been tested positive by Covid-19. However, 28.3% did have a family member or close relative who had been diagnosed, with almost 3% of the sample having to live with an infected person.\n\nHaving currently or previously Covid-19 symptoms and having a family member or close relative diagnosed and living with him was positively related to symptomatology. Receiving sufficient information was a protective factor in the appearance of symptoms of depression, anxiety and PSTD.\n\n3.4. Psychosocial variables and psychological impact\nLoneliness and discrimination showed a significant positive relationship with depressive, anxious and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Social support, sense of belonging, well-being and self-compassion had a significantly negative relationship.\n\nTable 1 shows the results of sociodemographic and psychosocial variables in more detail.\n\nTable 1.

Regressions on depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress\nThe model for depressive symptomatology was statistically significant, explaining 39.21% of the variance (F(6,3379) = 364.8, p<,001). For anxiety the model was also statistically significant, explaining 28.8% of the variance (F(5,3380) = 274.8, p<,001). Regarding the PSTD the model explained 13.96% (F(5,3380) = 110.9; p<,001). Significant common variables for the three models were spiritual well-being and loneliness. Female gender was significant for anxiety and PSTD.

Discussion\nThis is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. The scores of the different scales revealed how 18.7% of the sample disclosed a possible diagnosis of depression and 21.6% was likely to be potentially diagnosed with anxiety. Compared to other recently published studies, our results are slightly lower, although similar, with the numbers consistently around 20% (Cao et al., 2020, Kang et al., 2020, Pappa et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b). About the symptomatology of PTSD our results were similar to previous research conducted during the SARS epidemic outbreak in Canada (Reynolds et al., 2008).\n\nWith regard to the variables related to psychological impact, we have found that the female gender is associated with greater depressive symptoms, anxiety and PTSD. For instance, valuing the personal economic situation in a positive way and being retired or older, acted as protective factors for depression, anxiety and PSTD. This results are similar to the results of Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b, and Kang et al. (2020), and also to another study carried out in the Basque Country, where they found a greater psychological impact on younger people and those with previous illnesses (Dosil-Santamaria et al., 2020). Female gender was also found to be more related to symptomatology in the review of Pappa et al. (2020).\n\nIn terms of age, it should be noted that the age range of the oldest people in our study was 60–8, with an average of 64.85 years old, and a very low representation compared to other age groups. The lack of elderly people is also common in most studies, for example, in the study performed by Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b, the age range was 50–59. This indicates that older people are generally under-represented in current studies and no conclusions can be drawn about this age group.\n\nAdditionally, the results showed how discrimination and loneliness were related to a greater psychological impact, while the sense of belonging, well-being and self-compassion were protective. Discriminatory behavior against people infected appears to be quite frequent, and the presence of stigma associated with the diagnosis of a new disease quite common, as it has been reported in several previous studies carried out in quarantines (Desclaux et al., 2017). With respect to the current pandemic outbreak, it is possible to speak of certain coronophobia, as pointed out in a recent article by Asmundson and Taylor (2020).\n\nConcerning regression models, and in coherence with other studies in different clinical settings, spiritual well-being emerged as the most relevant protective factor for depression, anxiety and PSTD (Krupski et al., 2006, Saiz et al., 2020). Loneliness was the next main predictor for the three dependent variables. The importance of this variable is well stablished with a lot of studies reporting the relation with loneliness and depression and anxiety (Ausín et al., 2017).\n\nAdditionally, different variables were found to be relevant for each type of symptomatology. For depression, being retired was found to be a negative predictor, while being a student was a predictor of positive symptoms. Perhaps this could be because the younger population is less mature and has fewer personal resources to deal with a crisis.\n\nWith regard to anxiety, being a woman and feeling that you receive too much information were found to be predictors, while having the right information was a protector from the presence of anxiety. The role of information seemed to be fundamental and a negative relationship with the psychological impact was also found in Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b. However, information can be a double-edged sword if received in excess. The type and source of information in this situation seems fundamental to our psychological well-being (Ko et al., 2020), and raising awareness of the importance of accessing official information channels to avoid fake news, as well as turning to health professionals to resolve doubts or provide guidelines for action could be a priority in terms of measures to be implemented in this situation.\n\nFinally, concerning PTSD, having a partner and being a woman were found to be predictive variables. Thus, the female gender was a predictor of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms. Perhaps this was because the prevalence of anxiety and PTSD is usually higher among women (Haro et al., 2006). It is also necessary to highlight that women generally tend to assume a caregiving role, having to balance it with work and, usually household tasks, being a group at risk and more vulnerable in this situation of overload.\n\nThe current study presents several limitations. Firstly, the sample chosen through the snowball method may not represent the Spanish population. In relation to the data collection method, the use of the online tool limits access to persons who use this technology to a lesser degree, such as the elderly. Additionally, the number of men and older participants was lower than that of women and younger participants, with these groups being underrepresented. Furthermore, the data collected only refers to the first two weeks of the quarantine and alarm situation, and data is needed at a prospective level, including this line of work in our future research.\n\nThe results of this study provide the first data about the psychological impact of the Covid-19 carried out in the whole Spanish territory, suggesting the need for greater psychological support in general and in certain groups. Overall, women, younger people, people with previous diagnoses and those who showed symptoms or had a close relative with the disease showed a greater psychological impact, while spiritual well-being and loneliness emerged as the most relevant predictors for the symptomatology.",

It provides updated data for fall course plans, fall calendar start/end plans, course session plans and\nundergraduate enrollment indicators. In addition, new data is reported on social distancing measures, tuition\nplans, and perceptions of preparedness for fall overall.\nThe survey was open from Thursday May 14 to Tuesday May 19 at noon and received 376 responses in that\ntimeframe (94% from U.S. institutions). Seven respondents were from online-only institutions and were not asked\nthe questions about fall course delivery and social distancing measures. Other institutional characteristics include:\n• Control\no 63% private\no 37% public\n• Type\no 15% lower division only\no 19% undergraduate only\no 57% comprehensive\no 8% graduate and/or professional\no 1% other\n• Size\no 70% under 5,000\no 15% 5,000 to 9,999\no 14% 10,000+\no 2% unknown\nIt is worth noting that summer and fall 2020 enrollment indicators may also be attributed to factors other than the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Some data from the other three surveys is included in this report for comparison. However,\nthe participating institutions are not matched one for one among the four surveys, so absolute comparisons\ncannot be made. In other words, results are drawn from four separate samples. Please see the previous three\nreports for additional data:\n• COVID-19 #3: Transfer Credit Evaluation, Official Transcript Receipt & Delivery, Test Score Receipt and Fall\nCalendar/Sessions Plans\n• COVID-19 #2: Undergraduate Enrollment Indicators, Impact on Admissions Practice and Fall Course\nDelivery\n• COVID-19 #1: Impact on Grading, Transcript and Commencement Practices\nKey Data\n• There is a high degree of uncertainty around fall 2020 plans, which makes it difficult for many to act\no Some plan to make decisions in the next few weeks\no Even with this uncertainty, most are feeling “ok” about their institution’s overall level of\npreparedness for fall 2020\n• Compared to April, a slightly higher percentage of institutions report deciding on a fall course delivery\nscenario, but most remain undecided and many different scenarios are being considered1\n(please see\nfootnote 1)\n• Among those not yet confirmed to be fully online for fall 2020, 68% are asking their faculty to be prepared\nto teach fully online\n1 The participating institutions are not matched one for one among the four surveys so direct comparisons cannot\nbe made\n2\n• Except for one respondent, institutions are undecided whether waivers of responsibility for possible\nCOVID-19 infections will be implemented, and they are on the fence about whether that is likely to\nhappen or not\n• About 1 in 5 institutions have social distancing measures already in place for fall 2020\n• 14% are considering a change in tuition for fall 2020 in response to COVID-19\n• Undergraduate new student enrollment indicators look less bleak for summer and somewhat worse for\nsome indicators for fall than the sample in early April1\n• Graduate and/or professional new student enrollment indicators show less of a decline than\nundergraduate new student enrollment indicators\n• The number of institutions considering various changes to the fall calendar and class session start and end\ntimes has increased since asked in mid-April1\nAs always, we are grateful to our members for taking the time to respond to this survey during unprecedented\ninstitutional change. Due to the short turnaround time between data collection and release of the report, the data\nare necessarily reported in the aggregate. Free text response data is included as it was submitted by participants;\nit has not been edited and is for informational purposes only.

The notion of social distancing completely upends the goals of\na small private liberal arts residential college. It is really hard to carry out policies when they're in a total state of\nflux. That said, being required to think outside the box has allowed us to realize some improvements in\nantiquated processes.\nSo many things are being discussed at the VP level with little input from below, and no feedback - my concern is\nthat the clock is ticking.\nStill playing catch up with faculty online teaching comfort & competency\nTask force just getting started. looking for a July 1 roll out.\nThankfully this has been a pretty seamless transition for us - we just moved everything to online but we are a\nfree-standing graduate only program so housing isn't an issue and we already have a compressed schedule so\nwe are isolated from true disruption.\nThe ability for the college to offer a rotating or hybrid schedule for all sections will be nearly impossible if social\ndistancing remains in effect. We will have to focus on our courses that require a campus presence for social\ndistancing and likely move everything else online if we are unable to resume normal operations.\nThe College will have 20 plus students on campus for orientation on May 26th. The College waived tuition\ndeposits.\nThe larger question of test availability, ability to engage in contact tracing, contagion rates, etc. will have a\nprofound impact on our plans...but these factors are still unknown.\nThe most difficult area is planning for multiple futures.

Will faculty want to teach in person and if so how many? How many\nfamilies/students will want to come back for in person classes? If we do the 6ft social distancing in classrooms,\nwe may not have enough classrooms. If we make significant changes, i.e. requiring students to reschedule due\nto changes, will they come back?\nThere is a lack of decisive decision-making. Our institution has been behind the curve regarding solution and\naction-oriented decisions.\nThere is just so much uncertainty and an overwhelming amount of detail to consider.\nThey have not made a decision, which makes it impossible to plan.\nTo on-campus teach or not on-campus teach - that is the question.\nWe are a year-round school, and will begin our summer session at the end of June. All plans for COVID-19\npreparedness will be in place at that time. The key for our success in the Fall depends on the DOE extending the\nexception for distance education for previously non-approved programs. If that is not extended, and our\naccrediting body doesn't accelerate the approval process, we will be in trouble.\n16\nWe are actively making decisions in the next few weeks and will have a more solid plan by June 1.

There are many unknowns, so we are still waiting\nto see about testing and other things.\nWe are working diligently as an entire campus to prepare various plans for the Fall 2020 Semester.\nWe have a deadline of July 1 for a multi-scenario plan of action for the fall term. We are currently in the early\nplanning stages, thus I will feel much better as we near July.\nWe have a heavy population of student athletes. No fall sports would have huge impact on enrollment.\nWe have a number of task force working groups which are working well. A huge success was amping up our\nonline summer offerings, cutting our summer per credit price significantly and we are generating significant\nadditional revenue as a result. Although our FTFY apps and accepts were down, before the pandemic hit we\nwere running significantly ahead on deposits. We moved our deposit deadline to June 1 so we do not yet know\nwhere we will land. UG fall registrations are down, but only by a few percentage points at this time. For the fall\nwe are actively exploring how to significantly improve our delivery of only courses should we need to switch\nagain mid-semester and also to allow for supplementing or substituting course delivery through this means.\nWe have excellent remote and hybrid learning infrastructure. The more we move in that direction, the more\nconfident I am.\nWe were not prepared at all, but we adapted surprisingly quickly. The biggest challenge was for the less tech\nsavvy faculty that had not been using a Course Management System.\nWhile so much of the planning process focuses on keeping students, faculty, and staff healthy, we cannot forget\nabout the financial challenges that many families are experiencing.\n17\nAppendix A: Additional Fall Course Delivery Scenarios Under Consideration\n(unedited data)\nA blended hybrid approach, combining a couple of the \"15 scenarios\" into our unique solution.\nA class is divided in two.

Logistic and negative binomial regression models are used to examine whether these differences persist after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and prepandemic health conditions. To understand within-group differences in caregiving demands, the intensity of care provided by short-term and long-term caregivers, as well as selected patients’ health conditions are summarized.\n\nResults\nAdults’ mental and physical health varied substantially by caregiver status. Caregivers continued to fare worse than noncaregivers in terms of mental health and fatigue, and long-term caregivers were more likely to report headache, body aches, and abdominal discomfort than both short-term caregivers and noncaregivers, net of controls. The nature of caregiving differed between short-term and long-term caregivers, with the latter more likely to provide greater hours of care, and to be looking after patients with permanent medical conditions.\n\nDiscussion\nEfforts to understand and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on population health should include caregivers, whose mental and physical health were already vulnerable before COVID-19.\n\nCaregiving, Health disparities, Mental health\nTopic: abdominal painfatigueheadacheadultcaregiversdemographymental healthpainsocioeconomic factorsphysical healthpandemicshealth disparitypsychological distressmedically unexplained symptomscovid-19\nIssue Section: Virtual Collection: COVID19- Healthcare Challenges for Older Adults\nDecision Editor: Deborah S Carr, PhD, FGSA\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Americans’ health, particularly for vulnerable populations, and is expected to exacerbate existing health disparities (van Dorn et al., 2020; Sritharan & Sritharan, 2020). One such group, informal caregivers, who often already suffer from psychological and physical maladies (Billings et al., 2000; Pinquart & Sorenson, 2003), face additional challenges during the pandemic. A highly contagious virus, COVID-19 is most harmful to older adults and individuals with preexisting conditions, placing care recipients at higher risk of severe illness. With the added stress brought about by this knowledge, caregivers must navigate new, pandemic-induced social and economic circumstances, in continuing to provide care. With more than 47 million caregivers in the United States looking after an ill or disabled adult family member or friend (National Alliance for Caregiving, 2020), understanding their well-being during this public health crisis is a matter of national importance.\n\nCaregiving is associated with greater mental distress, especially depression and anxiety (Adelman et al., 2014). Often used as an example of a “chronic stress experience” (Schulz & Sherwood, 2008), mental health is poorer among those who provide intensive care in duration and/or scope (i.e., medical/nursing tasks and bathing), usually to patients with more advanced physical or cognitive impairments. Behavioral disturbances common with certain conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and intellectual disabilities may also negatively affect a caregiver’s psychological well-being (Collins & Swartz, 2011; Maes et al., 2003; Swinkels et al., 2019).\n\nCaregivers also often report physical ailments such as fatigue and bodily pain typical of “caregiver burden” (Grov et al., 2006; Spillman et al., 2014). More broadly, psychologically distressed individuals have comorbid somatic symptoms because of shared neurological pathways (Kruetzer et al., 2009; Trivedi, 2004). While physical pain also increases with age (Zimmer & Zajacova, 2020), population-based studies have established a relationship between mental health and somatic symptoms, independent of age (Haug et al., 2004). Furthermore, mind–body interaction research finds that the greater the number of somatic symptoms, the higher the chance of a mood disorder, and a positive relationship between having at least one physical symptom and the duration of depression (Ohayon & Schatzberg, 2003). Individuals with sustained care responsibilities, such as dementia caregivers, report more exhaustion and physical difficulties (Dassel & Carr, 2016).\n\nRecognizing the gravity of caregivers’ circumstances before COVID-19, this brief report describes the mental and physical health of caregivers compared to noncaregivers in the United States during the early part of the pandemic, differentiating between short-term and long-term caregivers. Second, this study examines whether differences among these groups are explained by controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and prepandemic health. Third, to understand potential differences in caregiving demands between short-term and long-term caregivers, care recipients’ health conditions and the intensity of assistance are summarized.\n\nMethod\nThis study uses data from the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative internet panel of more than 8,500 adults. Members were selected through address-based sampling, with oversamples of underrepresented groups. Internet-connected tablets were provided when needed. This study uses data from respondents who completed a caregiving survey fielded in January 2020 and a COVID-19 study fielded from April to May 2020 that captured information on their circumstances during the pandemic. Among the 5,558 individuals who completed both surveys, 339 were dropped based on missing values for the dependent variables, and an additional 435 were dropped due to missing values on the existing covariates, resulting in 4,784 respondents in the final analytic sample. Logistic and negative binomial regressions are used to examine whether the association between caregivers’ status and the specific health outcomes described below persist after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and preexisting health conditions.\n\nMeasures\nThis study examines one mental health and five physical health outcomes. Whether the respondent reported any psychological distress (0/1) in the past 14 days is constructed from the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. There are four indicator variables of the most prevalent somatic symptoms experienced in the past 7 days: headache, fatigue, body aches, and abdominal discomfort. The number of somatic conditions is a measure ranging from 0 to 4, based on summing the presence of the aforementioned somatic symptoms. See Supplementary Table 1 for the items used in creating these measures.\n\nCaregiver status is categorized as noncaregiver, short-term caregiver, and long-term caregiver. A caregiver is identified from a response to the following question focused on adult caregiving: “In the past 30 days, did you spend any time assisting a family member or close friend (e.g. parent, grandparent, wife, husband, adult child, other family member, neighbor or close friend) with their basic personal activities? By that we mean daily activities such as dressing, eating, bathing, paying bills, managing medication, food preparation, grocery shopping, doctor visits, emotional support, driving, and other types of personal assistance.” Using a question on the duration of care with response categories of 1 month, 2–3 months, 4–6 months, 7–12 months, and longer than 1 year, individuals who reported assuming their caregiving role for a year or less are considered short-term caregivers, and those helping for greater than 1 year are treated as long-term caregivers. This demarcation also aligns with findings of worse health among caregivers of at least a year (National Alliance on Caregiving, 2020).\n\nControls\nThe multivariate analyses control for the following demographic characteristics: sex (0/1), age (18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–64, 65–74, and 75 and older), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Other). Non-Hispanic Other includes groups with sample sizes too small to distinguish separately: Asians, Native Americans, and multiracial individuals. There are three socioeconomic controls: holds a college degree (0/1), currently employed (0/1), and household income in U.S. dollars (<25,000, 25,000–49,999, 50,000–69,999, 75,000–99,999, and 100,000+). Because pandemic-related changes vary by locality, there is a control for geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). As caregivers likely had poorer prepandemic health relative to noncaregivers, there are two controls for preexisting conditions: the number of chronic conditions (0, 1, and 2+) and any anxiety or depression (0/1). Family and household characteristics that likely affect well-being include couple status (0/1) where coupled is defined as married or cohabiting, living with a child younger than 18 years (0/1), and household size.\n\nResults\nTable 1 presents higher proportions of poorer health during the pandemic across all outcomes among caregivers compared to noncaregivers, with long-term caregivers reporting the highest rates, followed by short-term caregivers. Among the study outcomes, psychological distress was the most common, reported by 35.2%, 42.3%, and 46.5% of noncaregivers, short-term caregivers, and long-term caregivers, respectively. There are modest differences between short-term caregivers and noncaregivers for headaches and abdominal discomfort. However, disparities in somatic symptoms between long-term caregivers and noncaregivers are consistently much larger (44%–60% higher).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.Descriptive Statistics of Sample by Caregiver Status\nNoncaregiver (N = 3,433)\tShort-term caregiver (up to 1 year; N = 689)\tLong-term caregiver (greater than 1 year; N = 662)\n% or Mean (SE)\t\t\nAny psychological distressa \t35.2 \t42.3 \t46.5 \nSomatic symptomsb \t \t \t \n Headache \t21.5 \t22.8 \t31.5 \n Fatigue \t19.9 \t24.5 \t28.8 \n Body aches \t13.5 \t17.9 \t20.1 \n Abdominal discomfort \t7.5 \t7.7 \t12.0 \n Number of somatic symptoms (0–4) \t0.62 (0.018) \t0.73 (0.041) \t0.92 (0.044) \nIndependent variables \t \t \t \nMale \t51.4 \t40.4 \t43.9 \nAge (years) \t \t \t \n 18–29 \t11.5 \t13.7 \t9.7 \n 30–39 \t24.9 \t20.7 \t16.8 \n 40–49 \t15.1 \t16.1 \t17.7 \n 50–64 \t27.0 \t30.3 \t35.1 \n 65–74 \t14.6 \t13.9 \t16.4 \n 75+ \t6.9 \t5.2 \t4.3 \nRace/ethnicity \t \t \t \n Non-Hispanic White \t67.8 \t65.2 \t64.7 \n Non-Hispanic Black \t10.3 \t13.5 \t11.8 \n Hispanic \t12.6 \t14.2 \t9.5 \n Non-Hispanic Otherc \t9.3 \t7.0 \t14.1 \nCoupled \t56.2 \t55.4 \t57.1 \nMinor child in the household \t32.7 \t34.7 \t33.6 \nHousehold size \t2.72 (1.437) \t2.82 (1.501) \t3.01 (1.613) \nHas college degree \t36.6 \t30.7 \t29.4 \nCurrently employed \t59.7 \t55.5 \t55.7 \nHousehold income (in U.S. dollars) \t \t \t \n < 25,000 \t19.2 \t21.9 \t20.4 \n 25,000–49,999 \t20.3 \t23.9 \t23.8 \n 50,000–69,999 \t18.6 \t17.8 \t22.3 \n 75,000–99,999 \t13.9 \t12.2 \t13.2 \n 100,000+ \t28.0 \t24.3 \t20.2 \nRegion \t \t \t \n Northeast \t21.9 \t19.1 \t19.5 \n Midwest \t17.4 \t20.0 \t20.1 \n South \t37.8 \t39.0 \t38.3 \n West \t22.9 \t21.9 \t22.2 \nNumber of preexisting chronic conditionsd \t \t \t \n None \t48.8 \t42.8 \t40.8 \n One \t26.6 \t24.0 \t25.6 \n Two+ \t24.6 \t33.2 \t33.7 \nAnxiety or depression prior to pandemice \t21.5 \t26.5 \t31.6 \nNote: Weighted using sample weights.\n\naMeasure of any psychological distress is constructed from reports of experiences in the past 14 days.\n\nbMeasures of somatic symptoms are constructed from reports of experiences in the past 7 days.\n\ncThis category includes groups with small sample sizes: mixed race, Asian, and American Indian.\n\ndChronic conditions include diabetes, cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, and obesity.\n\neThe period prior to the pandemic is before March 10, 2020.\n\nOpen in new tab\nFurther inspection across these groups suggests that these disparities are likely partially explained by compositional differences, as populations with fewer resources experience worse health (Braveman et al., 2010). Caregivers are more racially diverse and less likely to hold a college degree or be employed. They also live in larger households but have lower household incomes. As expected, 33.7% of caregivers live with multimorbidity compared to 24.6% of noncaregivers. Long-term caregivers are more prone than short-term caregivers to have had a mental health condition prior to the pandemic (31.6% vs. 26.5%), and both are more likely than noncaregivers (21.5%).\n\nTo understand whether these attributes explain the observed differences in health during the pandemic by caregiver status, six separate regression models were run, controlling for the independent variables in Table 1 (see Supplementary Table 2 for full results). The predicted probabilities by caregiver status shown in Figure 1 are derived from these models, setting the other covariates at their means. Controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and preexisting health traits reduces differences between long-term caregivers and noncaregivers most appreciably, although statistically significant differences for these two groups remain across all outcomes. Short-term caregivers also remain more likely to report psychological distress than noncaregivers. They are not, however, statistically more likely to report somatic symptoms than noncaregivers. In terms of within-caregiver differences, short-term and long-term caregivers are equally likely to report fatigue, but long-term caregivers are statistically more likely to report headaches, body aches, abdominal discomfort, and more somatic symptoms.\n\nFigure 1.\nPredicted probabilities of mental health and somatic symptoms by caregiver status.

Long-term caregivers provide greater hours of care (117.6 hr/month) than their short-term counterparts (80.9 hr/month), with almost twice the proportion providing near round-the-clock care (greater than 480 hr/month, or 16+ hr/day). Long-term caregivers are also more likely to report looking after someone with permanent medical conditions, such as neurogenerative diseases or intellectual or developmental disabilities. Other conditions that require high levels of caregiver vigilance, such as a mental illness or impaired vision, are also more common among long-term caregivers’ patients.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.Selected Caregiving Characteristics by Caregiver Status (N = 1,351)\nShort-term (N = 689)\tLong-term (N = 662)\n% or Mean (SE)\t\nHours of caregiving in the last 30 days \t \t \n Mean \t80.9 (10.79) \t117.6 (13.52) \nDistribution \t \t \n 1–5 \t26.8 \t20.6 \n 6–20 \t39.6 \t38.6 \n 21–40 \t10.4 \t10.7 \n 41–80 \t6.6 \t8.5 \n 81–240 \t5.7 \t7.0 \n 241–480 \t4.5 \t2.5 \n >480 \t6.5 \t12.2 \nCare recipient conditiona \t \t \n Neurogenerative diseaseb \t17.0 \t17.8 \n Mental illness or psychiatric disability \t11.2 \t17.1 \n Intellectual or developmental disability \t4.5 \t8.1 \n Debilitating arthritis \t6.3 \t10.1 \n Impaired vision or blindness \t8.1 \t9.7 \nNote: Weighted using sample weights.\n\naCare recipient conditions are not mutually exclusive.\n\nbThis category includes Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia, Multiple Sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nOpen in new tab\nDiscussion\nDuring the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, adults’ mental and physical health varied substantially by caregiver status. Caregivers continued to fare worse than noncaregivers in terms of mental health and fatigue, and long-term caregivers were more likely to report headache, body aches, and abdominal discomfort than both short-term caregivers and noncaregivers, even after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and preexisting health traits. Consistent with other studies (National Alliance on Caregiving, 2020; Wolff et al., 2016), the intensity of care increases with longer durations of care. Thus, the caregiver status measure is potentially capturing intensive versus less intensive caregiving as well. Long-term caregivers’ patients were more likely to have permanent medical conditions. These differences in caregiving responsibilities suggest other potential mechanisms through which caregiver health is affected. For example, the physical burden of tasks may directly affect physical health, while caregiving intensity can limit the time available for caregivers to manage their own health (Spillman et al., 2014).\n\nIt is important to note that while this study controls for preexisting physical and mental health conditions at the time of the caregiving survey but prior to the pandemic, it remains unclear whether individuals with poorer health are self-selected into caregiving roles, or if their health is a negative consequence of caregiving. Furthermore, some respondents, particularly short-term caregivers, may have stopped caregiving by the start of the pandemic, potentially modestly underestimating the health of noncaregivers. Also, practices intended to protect the infirm such as physical distancing may have had unintended consequences on caregiver responsibilities. Caregiving could intensify for long-term caregivers who tend to look after individuals with greater health challenges, helping with activities of daily living that cannot be postponed. Moreover, additional assistance may be required to help care recipients manage health complications related to interruptions in medical treatment or COVID-19 exposure. In contrast, caregivers who mostly provide support for instrumental activities of daily living such as transportation and shopping may be able to pause or outsource some tasks during the pandemic.\n\nGiven the protracted nature of the pandemic, new challenges that are consequential for caregiver health are bound to emerge. Preliminary mortality data suggest some caregivers, such as racial minorities and those who care for individuals in noncommunity-dwelling settings, are more likely to have a family or friend die of COVID-19 (Van Houtven et al., 2020). Furthermore, the economic fallout from the pandemic is still unfolding, potentially compounding caregivers’ existing financial responsibilities (Institute of Medicine, 2016). COVID-19 has clearly revealed the “frailties and inequalities” (United Nations, 2020) of American society, underscoring the need to include caregivers in current efforts to understand and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on population health.",

Public universities in urban centers represent a substantial proportion of college students in the USA. We implemented a cross-sectional population-based online survey of 2282 students in a large, public university in New York City in April 2020. We created weights to account for non-response and used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with mental health outcomes. Students experienced high rates of anxiety/depression and financial instability due to the pandemic. Half of the students reported anxiety/depression (54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (81.1%) reported loss of household income, and half (49.8%) reported worries about losing housing. High levels of food (aPR  = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6) and housing (aPR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) insecurity were the strongest predictors of anxiety/depression. Household and personal experiences with possible COVID-19 symptoms were also associated with anxiety/depression or the need for increased mental health services. Addressing student needs at public urban universities requires an integrated holistic approach that targets urgent mental health and economic needs related to the impact of COVID-19. Students who become infected need mental health services as well as health monitoring.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19, College students, Mental health, New York City\nGo to:\nIntroduction\nIn the United States of America (USA), New York City (NYC) became the first epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in late March 2020 [1]. During this first wave in NYC, the epidemic peaked with an estimated 7-day rolling average high of over 5200 cases in early April 2020 and a death rate of 228 confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people between March and August 2020 [2], the true death rate is likely higher [3]. The primary public health response to the pandemic promoted social distancing to reduce community transmission, including shifting to online learning environments for schools and college campuses. The City University of New York (CUNY), a public university with 25 campuses across the five boroughs of NYC, officially closed its physical facilities and began virtual classes on March 19, 2020 in response to the pandemic [4].\n\nIn 2019–2020, CUNY enrolled a large, diverse student body, with an estimated 274,000 matriculated students in programs that offer associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degrees. Many CUNY students come from low-income households; in 2016, an estimated three in five CUNY undergraduates lived in households with annual incomes of less than $30,000 [5]. At the same time, a number of CUNY campuses rank highly among US colleges for the upward financial mobility of their graduates [6]. Furthermore, about 40% of New York City’s 689,000 college students are enrolled at CUNY [7]. Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their health and well-being can inform interventions and policies to mitigate harm, with implications for health, equity, economic development, higher education, and social justice in the region. These findings may also be applicable to other large public urban universities across the country. We sought to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CUNY students’ self-reported general and mental health, as well as on their financial stability at the height of the first wave of the epidemic in NYC.\n\nGo to:\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional online survey of a representative sample of CUNY students from April 14 to 22, 2020. The study was reviewed and approved by the CUNY School of Public Health’s Institutional Review Board (Protocol #695980); the survey began with informed consent, requiring participants to indicate consent electronically prior to starting the survey. The first 1000 respondents received a $20 gift card for their participation by email, and five respondents among all who participated were randomly selected to receive $100 gift cards.\n\nSample\nIn collaboration with the CUNY Office of Institutional Research, which maintains a centralized database of CUNY students, we used simple random selection to select 10,000 students from the approximately 274,000 matriculated students in the spring 2020 semester. Of those, 2282 completed 70% or more of the entire survey (response rate of 23%) and are included in this analysis. Given the response bias, we created sampling weights to account for non-response based on sex, race/ethnicity, type of campus (undergraduate versus graduate), and full-time or part-time student status; all measures are available in the CUNY central database.\n\nSurvey instrument\nThe survey was pilot tested with five students to ensure comprehension and readability and was designed to take 15 minutes to complete. The survey comprised five domains: educational experience, household/living situation, economic impact, health impact, and socio-demographic characteristics; other socio-demographic and student status data such as sex (categorized as male or female), race/ethnicity, campus, and full-time or part-time student status were taken from the centralized student database. Items to assess health included a question on general health as recalled at the beginning of the semester and at the time of the survey taken from the Health-Related Quality of Life Healthy Days Core Module (CDC HRQOL– 4) [8], the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression [9, 10], and changes in patterns of substance use. Experiences with COVID-19 symptoms and testing were also assessed. To measure economic impact, we included questions on loss of income, changes in household expenses, food insecurity (adapted from the 6-item USDA Food Security Survey) [11], and concerns about housing costs. Each domain primarily consisted of closed ended questions; all but the socio-demographic section ended with an open-ended question for students to describe anything that was missed about their experiences in their own words. Similarly, questions that allowed students to select more than one option included an “other” category with space for text, in case important response categories were missed. The current analysis focuses on the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CUNY students; future analyses will focus on the effect on educational experiences.\n\nAnalysis\nWe present weighted estimates of socio-demographic characteristics by level of students (associate, bachelor's, or graduate degree) as an overview of the CUNY student population. Next, we present weighted estimates of students’ reports on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and economic measures. We used chi-squared tests to compare reports on changes in substance use and anticipated graduation by anxiety/depression. Finally, we conducted weighted multivariable Poisson regression models with robust standard errors to estimate the prevalence ratios for factors hypothesized to be associated with anxiety/depression, and an increased need for mental health services as a result of the pandemic. For these models, we explored bivariate associations with exposures to stressors including the following: concerns about losing housing, reduced ability to buy needed food, students or household members experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms, having a household member who is a healthcare worker, being a parent or guardian, being a caretaker of adult(s) over age 65, and whether students expected to graduate later than previously anticipated, as hypothesized contributors to anxiety/depression. Changes to substance use were not included, as we hypothesized that anxiety/depression may have led to increased substance use. We also explored bivariate associations with socio-demographic characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, age) and student characteristics (associates, bachelor’s or graduate; full-time versus part-time student; New York City, New York state, other state, or international residency status) as potential confounders of our hypothesized exposures. No independent variables in the final adjusted models were strongly correlated with one another (correlation of 0.50 or greater). Final models include exposures associated with the outcome at the bivariate level, which remained significant (p < 0.05) in multivariable models, after adjusting for race/ethnicity and age. Type of degree (associate, bachelor’s or graduate), full-time versus part-time student, residency status, being a parent/guardian, and having a family member work in healthcare were not significantly associated with anxiety/depression or increased need for mental health in fully adjusted models and were not included in the final models.\n\nFor open-ended questions or “other” response categories, we identified common themes and had two independent reviewers code each quote in a blinded fashion with discussion to resolve discrepancies. We present the frequency with which themes about mental health and financial stability arose, and include illustrative quotes to contextualize the quantitative findings and illuminate the lived experiences of students.\n\nGo to:\nResults\nCUNY students are generally young (66.0% 18–25 years of age) and more female than male (57.9% versus 42.1% respectively, Table ​Table1).1). Over one quarter of students are Hispanic (29.4%), followed by Black non-Hispanic (24.9%), White non-Hispanic (23.0%), and Asian Pacific Islander (22.1%), with 0.4% American Indian/Native Alaskan. Students enrolled in associate, bachelor's and graduate programs differ by socio-demographic characteristics such as female-male ratio, age, and race/ethnicity (Table ​(Table1).1). Only 1.9% of students reported living in school dormitories prior to the pandemic, with the remainder in different types of off-campus living situations; living with a parent or relative (56.2%) or in their own house/rental apartment (34.7%) were the most common.\n\nTable 1\nSocio-demographic characteristics by associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate student, City University of New York (CUNY) Student COVID-19 Survey, April 2020\n\nAssociate degree\n(n = 713)\tBachelor’s degree\n(n = 1232)\tGraduate degree\n(n = 337)\tTotal\n(n = 2282)\nActual n\tWeighted %\n(95% CIs)\tActual n\tWeighted %\n(95% CIs)\tActual n\tWeighted %\n(95% CIs)\tActual n\tWeighted %\n(95% CIs)\nSex\n  Female\t483\t59.0 (55.2, 62.8)\t804\t55.7 (52.8, 58.6)\t236\t64.6 (58.9, 69.8)\t1523\t57.9 (55.7, 60.0)\n  Male\t230\t41.0 (37.2, 44.8)\t428\t44.3 (41.4, 47.2)\t101\t35.4 (30.2, 41.1)\t759\t42.1 (40.0, 44.3)\nRace/ethnicity*\n  White non-Hispanic\t107\t15.8 (13.2, 18.7)\t274\t23.0 (20.6, 25.5)\t148\t43.3 (38.0, 48.8)\t529\t23.0 (21.3, 24.9)\n  Black non-Hispanic\t195\t30.4 (27.0, 34.1)\t257\t23.2 (20.8, 25.8)\t55\t17.9 (14.0, 23.1)\t507\t24.9 (23.1, 26.9)\n  Hispanic\t251\t33.5 (30.1, 37.1)\t371\t29.5 (27.0, 32.2)\t59\t18.1 (14.1, 23.1)\t681\t29.4 (27.6, 31.4)\n  Asian/Pacific Islander\t151\t19.5 (16.8, 22.6)\t326\t24.0 (21.7, 26.5)\t74\t20.7 (16.7, 25.3)\t551\t22.1 (20.4, 23.9)\n  Amer.

More than one quarter (29.4%) reported experiencing symptoms that could be COVID-19, of whom only 15.4% were tested. Among all students, 5.8% were tested for COVID-19 of whom 29.1% reported a positive result (at the time of the survey, testing was not widely available in New York City [12]. More than a quarter (29.5%) of students also reported someone in their household had experienced symptoms that could be COVID-19.\n\nTable 2\nHealth and financial impact of COVID-19 pandemic, City University of New York (CUNY) Student COVID-19 Survey, April 2020\n\nTotal\n(n = 2282)\nHealth and financial impact indicators\tActual n\tWeighted %\n(95% CIs)\nGeneral health at beginning of semester*\n  Excellent/very good\t1038\t68.4 (66.4, 70.3)\n  Good\t606\t23.4 (21.7, 25.2)\n  Fair/Poor\t628\t8.2 (7.1, 9.4)\nGeneral health since COVID-19 epidemic*\n  Excellent/very good\t464\t47.1 (45.0, 49.2)\n  Good\t606\t26.3 (24.5, 28.2)\n  Fair/poor\t502\t26.6 (24.8, 28.5)\nExperienced COVID-19-like symptoms*\t663\t29.4 (27.5, 31.4)\nHousehold member experienced COVID-19 like symptoms*\t658\t29.5 (27.6, 31.5)\nDepression*\t963\t43.2 (41.1, 45.3)\nAnxiety*\t993\t42.2 (40.1, 44.4)\nIncreased need for help with stress/anxiety*\t1116\t49.0 (46.9, 51.2)\nLoss of household income*\t1799\t81.1 (79.3, 82.7)\nReduced household ability to buy food*\n  A lot\t547\t24.1 (22.3, 26.0)\n  Somewhat\t823\t35.9 (33.9, 38.0)\n  A little\t558\t24.7 (22.9, 26.6)\n  Not at all/made it easier\t340\t15.2 (13.7, 16.8)\nOften/sometimes worried about running out of food before able to afford more*\t1150\t50.1 (48.0, 52.2)\nOften/sometimes skip a meal because cannot afford food*\t597\t26.6 (24.8, 28.6)\nOften/sometimes unable to eat nutritious meals for lack of money*\t796\t35.4 (33.4, 37.5)\nOften/sometimes have gone hungry for lack of access to food*\t403\t17.9 (16.3, 19.6)\nHow worried about losing housing*\n  Very worried\t317\t14.1 (12.7, 15.7)\n  Somewhat worried\t812\t35.7 (33.7, 37.7)\n  Not worried at all\t1143\t50.2 (48.1, 52.3)\nExpect to graduate*\n  Later than expected\t586\t26.2 (24.4, 28.2)\n  Do not know\t665\t29.3 (27.4, 31.3)\n  Earlier/same time as expected\t1030\t44.4 (42.3, 46.5)\nOpen in a separate window\n* Sample size varies from 2215 to 2281 due to missing values\n\nMore than half of students (54.5%) reported experiencing anxiety and/or depression, with 43.2% reporting anxiety and 42.2% depression. Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and/or depressed was also a common theme identified in open-ended questions. When asked, to describe other effects of the coronavirus on their educational experience in an open-ended question, 37.3% of the participants responded. Mental health was identified as a theme in 26.8% of these responses. One student described it this way, “I have this feeling of impending doom like world war three will start, I’m scared.”\n\nAlmost half (49.0%) reported an increased need for mental health services to help cope with stress, anxiety, or depression due to the pandemic. Some students reported increased substance use in response to the pandemic: 13.6% reported increased usage of alcohol, 8.1% marijuana, 4.0% vaping, and 3.4% cigarette smoking. Students who had anxiety/depression were two to three times as likely to report an increase in substance use as those not reporting anxiety/depression: alcohol usage (17.8% versus 8.3%, p < 0.01), marijuana use (10.6% versus 4.9%, p < 0.01), vaping (5.8% versus 1.9%, p < 0.01), and cigarette smoking (4.5% versus 2.1%, p < 0.01).\n\nMore than half of students (56.8%) reported their ability to do schoolwork decreased as a result of the pandemic, of whom 73.4% identified their mental state as a reason for this decrease. This belief was also identified in open-ended responses. When asked, “What has affected your ability to do schoolwork,” 4.5% (n = 102) selected “other” and provided text responses, of which 30.4% were coded as mental health–related. One student wrote, “My mind wanders too much because I am anxious.” Another student explained, “It is mentally exhausting not knowing what’s happening. Not knowing what the future holds.” One quarter (26.2%) reported expecting to graduate later than anticipated as a result of the pandemic, and another 29.3% were uncertain of its impact on graduation date (Table ​(Table2).2). Those experiencing anxiety/depression were more likely to report anticipating graduating later than expected than those not reporting anxiety/depression (32.1% versus 19.2%, p < 0.01).\n\nEconomic outcomes\nThe majority of students (81.1%) reported that they (54.1%) and/or someone else in their household (68.9%) lost income as a result of the pandemic. Nearly half (47.8%) reported their weekly household expenses increased, with 21.2% reporting a decrease in weekly expenses and 30.9% no change. The biggest increases in household expenses reported were an increase in the cost of cleaning supplies (72.9%) and food costs (71.4%), followed by an increase in the cost of support for family members outside of the household (37.4%), entertainment (30.8%), and medical costs (28.8%).\n\nHalf of the students (49.8%) reported being very or somewhat worried about losing their housing as a result of the pandemic and about half reported experiencing some forms of food insecurity in the 2 weeks preceding the survey (Table ​(Table2).2). For example, 13.2% reported often and 37.0% sometimes being worried they would run out of food before being able to afford more, and 4.5% often and 13.3% sometimes had gone hungry for lack of access to food. Sixty percent (60.0%) reported their household’s ability to purchase food had been reduced a lot (24.1%) or somewhat (35.9%) as a result of the pandemic. Food insecurity was identified as a theme in open-ended responses as well. For example, when asked about other ways the coronavirus has affected their current living situation, of the 21.6% who responded (n = 493), 9.7% of the responses were coded as relating to food insecurity. One student reported, “Since the epidemic began, unfortunately only my uncle is working and we are trying to make ends meet with the rent and the utility bills. It’s been stressful because some days we eat less just to be cautious of how much money is being spent.”\n\nStudents also identified general financial concerns. Among the 21.6% who described other ways the coronavirus has affected their current living conditions, 61.1% of the responses were coded as financial concerns. One student explained, “My mom has been reduced to working 10–15 [hours], risking her health to pay her rent which hasn’t been postponed. She has no health care, so my income is going to her for her to pay for food and rent.” Another student reported, “I’m not sure how long I’ll be employed. While I work additional hours online now, there is no guarantee that I’ll be working much longer. My landlady isn’t exactly understanding so there is a chance that eviction could be an issue.”\n\nFactors associated with anxiety/depression and increased need for mental health services\nFemales were 1.4 (95% confidence intervals (CIs), 1.2, 1.5) times as likely as males to report anxiety/depression, with no significant differences by age (Table ​(Table3).3). Financial stressors—the ability to buy food reduced by a lot (aPR = 1.4, 95% CIs 1.2, 1.6) and being very worried about losing housing (aPR = 1.3, 95% CIs 1.2, 1.4)—and expecting to graduate later than originally planned (aPR = 1.3, 95% CIs 1.1, 1.4) had the strongest associations with anxiety/depression in adjusted models. Being a caretaker for an adult over the age of 65 (aPR = 1.2, 95% CIs 1.1, 1.4) and having a household member who experienced COVID-like symptoms (aPR = 1.2, 95% CIs 1.1, 1.3) were also associated with anxiety/depression. Similarly, financial stressors and being female were the exposures with the strongest association with reporting an increased need for mental health support (Table ​(Table2).2). Reports of needing an increased level of mental health support were associated with the student experiencing COVID-like symptoms (aPR = 1.2, 95% CIs 1.1, 1.3), rather than a household member experiencing symptoms.\n\nTable 3\nFactors associated with anxiety/depression and an increased need for mental health services, City University of New York (CUNY) Student COVID-19 Survey, April 2020\n\nAnxiety/depression\n(n = 2206)\tIncreased need for mental health services (n = 2185)\nWeighted estimates\tWeighted %\tCrude PR\n(95% CI)\tAdjusted PR (95% CI)\tWeighted %\tCrude PR (95% CI)\tAdjusted PR (95% CI)\nSex\n  Female\t61.4\t1.4 (1.2, 1.5)\t1.4 (1.2, 1.5)\t56.3\t1.4 (1.3, 1.6)\t1.4 (1.2, 1.5)\n  Male\t45.1\t1.0\t1.0\t39.1\t1.0\t1.0\nRace/ethnicity\n  White non-Hispanic\t56.9\t1.0\t1.0\t52.4\t1.0\t1.0\n  Black non-Hispanic\t49.5\t0.9 (0.8, 1.0)\t0.8 (0.7, 0.9)\t44.0\t0.8 (0.7, 1.0)\t1.4 (0.5, 3.8)\n  Hispanic\t58.2\t1.0 (0.9, 1.1)\t1.1 (0.6, 1.9)\t53.2\t1.0 (0.9, 1.1)\t1.6 (0.6, 4.6)\n  Asian/Pacific Islander\t53.0\t0.9 (0.8, 1.0)\t1.0 (0.6, 1.8)\t46.1\t0.9 (0.8, 1.0)\t1.4 (0.5, 4.0)\n  American Indian/Native Alaskan\t46.6\t0.8 (0.4, 1.6)\t–\t25.8\t0.5 (0.2, 1.4)\t–\nAge in years\n  18–20\t51.9\t1.0\t1.0\t43.6\t1.0\t1.0\n  21–25\t55.1\t1.1 (1.0, 1.2)\t1.0 (0.9. 1.1)\t48.9\t1.1 (1.0, 1.3)\t1.1 (0.9, 1.2)\n  26–30\t57.9\t1.1 (1.0, 1.3)\t1.0 (0.9, 1.2)\t53.2\t1.2 (1.1, 1.4)\t1.1 (1.0, 1.3)\n  31–35\t57.6\t1.1 (0.9. 1.3)\t1.0 (0.9, 1.2)\t54.7\t1.3 (1.1, 1.5)\t1.1 (1.0, 1.3)\n  36 + \t51.9\t1.0 (0.9, 1.2)\t0.9 (0.8, 1.0)\t53.8\t1.2 (1.0, 1.4)\t1.1 (1.0, 1.3)\nCaretaker for adult(s) aged 65 + \n  Yes\t74.2\t1.4 (1.3, 1.6)\t1.2 (1.1, 1.4)\t59.3\t1.2 (1.1, 1.4)\t1.0 (0.9, 1.2)\n  No\t52.9\t1.0\t1.0\t48.3\t1.0\t1.0\nStudent had COVID-19–like symptoms\n  Yes\t64.0\t1.3 (1.2, 1.4)\t1.1 (1.0, 1.2)\t59.4\t1.3 (1.2, 1.4)\t1.2 (1.1, 1.3)\n  No\t50.6\t1.0\t1.0\t44.9\t1.0\t1.0\nHousehold member had COVID-19-like symptoms\n  Yes\t64.4\t1.3 (1.2, 1.4)\t1.2 (1.1, 1.3)\t55.8\t1.2 (1.1, 1.3)\t1.1 (1.0, 1.2)\n  No\t50.3\t1.0\t1.0\t46.2\t1.0\t1.0\nReduced household ability to buy food\n  A lot\t66.9\t1.6 (1.4, 1.9)\t1.4 (1.2, 1.6)\t61.1\t1.9 (1.6, 2,2)\t1.6 (1.3, 1.9)\n  Somewhat\t54.8\t1.3 (1.2, 1.6)\t1.2 (1.0, 1.4)\t52.5\t1.6 (1.4, 1.9)\t1.5 (1.2, 1.7)\n  A little\t50.8\t1.2 (1.1, 1.4)\t1.2 (1.0, 1.4)\t42.2\t1.3 (1.1, 1.6)\t1.2 (1.0, 1.5)\n  Not at all/made it easier\t41.1\t1.0\t1.0\t32.6\t1.0\t1.0\nHow worried about losing housing\n  Very worried\t72.2\t1.5 (1.4, 1.7)\t1.3 (1.2, 1.4)\t62.5\t1.5 (1.4, 1.7)\t1.3 (1.1, 1.4)\n  Somewhat worried\t58.3\t1.2 (1.1, 1.4)\t1.1 (1.0, 1.3)\t55.2\t1.3 (1.2, 1.5)\t1.2 (1.1, 1.4)\n  Not worried at all\t47.2\t1.0\t1.0\t41.1\t1.0\t1.0\nExpect to graduate\n  Later than expected\t66.7\t1.4 (1.3, 1.6)\t1.3 (1.1, 1.4)\t59.3\t1.3 (1.2, 1.5)\t1.1 (1.0, 1.3)\n  Do not know\t55.6\t1.2 (1.1, 1.3)\t1.1 (1.0, 1.2)\t46.6\t1.0 (0.9, 1.2)\t1.0 (0.9, 1.1)\n  Earlier/same time as expected\t46.7\t1.0\t1.0\t44.5\t1.0\t1.0\nOpen in a separate window\nPR prevalence ratio, CI confidence interval\n\nThe synergistic impact of financial stressors, health of family members, and one’s own health on respondents’ mental health was also evident in many of the open-ended responses. One student explained the relationship between mental health and financial stressors as follows, “Being fired from my job gives me plenty of free time but causes many panic attacks. I am very stressed and scared for my health and my family as well. Financially we’ve been struggling a lot.” In talking about the health of family members, a student explained, “I find it extremely difficult to concentrate because I am in constant fear my child or my elderly parents are going to die…” Another student described coping with loss, “My father passed away because of the virus. It has been really hard because he was my everything…” One student described why the virus was stressful for her, “During the time I believed I had the virus, I was very worried and unable to focus. Now is mostly a concern about how long this will go on and will it affect my ability to take care of my family financially.”\n\nGo to:\nDiscussion\nIn April 2020, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was high among CUNY students—more than double the estimate of these conditions from a representative survey of CUNY students in 2018 [13]. This finding is consistent with national studies indicating elevated levels of depression and anxiety among adults as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [14]. Furthermore, CUNY students reported high levels of economic instability, with a high percentage reporting loss of household income, concerns about housing, and food insecurity. Many students were also concerned about delays to graduation as a result of the pandemic. Previous studies have shown that food insecurity, depression, and anxiety can undermine academic success [15–17]. The significant increase in these conditions among college students found in our survey and other studies on the impact of the COVID-19 [18] suggests that the pandemic may disrupt the progress of many students in completing their college degrees, a credential that offers lifetime health, economic, and social benefits [19].\n\nIn multivariable models, concerns about the ability to pay for housing and food, the student or someone in their household experiencing possible COVID-19 symptoms, and caretaking for adults over the age of 65 were associated with worse mental health outcomes. These findings are consistent with a study of medical college students in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, which found that family economic stability was associated with reduced levels of anxiety, and being sick or having a family member be sick were associated with increased anxiety levels [20]. Findings are also consistent with a study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which found that, for young adults, being an unpaid caretaker was associated with poor mental health outcomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic [14]. Females generally have higher rates of anxiety/depression than males in the general population [21] and tend to have higher caretaking responsibilities [22] which may explain our finding that females were at higher risk for anxiety/depression than males.\n\nOur study has a number of limitations. Recall bias may have affected students’ reports on general health at the beginning of the semester. We collected cross-sectional data in April 2020 prior to the first stimulus bill, which temporarily increased unemployment benefits. The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is changing, and students may be experiencing different levels of financial instability given the temporal changes to available benefits. We had a 23% response rate, which may introduce bias in our results, even with the creation of non-response weights. Finally, our study is cross-sectional, and thus, factors associated with mental health outcomes may not be causal. We note, however, that there is a plausible mechanism by which financial stressors, dealing with COVID-19 illness, being a caretaker and worries about delays in graduation could lead to poor mental health and many of the open-ended responses support the direction of these associations.\n\nOur results suggest that to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on low-income urban college students requires a multi-pronged approach. First, universities need to ensure that students have access to campus, community, and telehealth mental health services. In our study, students with anxiety/depression were more likely to report increased substance use and increased anxiety around delays to graduation, than those not experiencing anxiety/depression, highlighting the importance of reaching these students. Even before the pandemic, college students and other young adults often had limited access to affordable mental health services [23], this problem likely has been exacerbated by COVID-19. Despite the need to ensure remote services during COVID-19, a review of 138 college websites in the NYC metropolitan area found that only half included information on how students could access remote mental health services [24].\n\nEnsuring access to mental health services may not be sufficient to address high rates of anxiety/depression without also addressing basic needs. The fact that a sizable proportion of CUNY students are experiencing financial instability including fear of losing housing and food insecurity needs to be addressed. These findings likely apply to many college students in public universities in the USA. A study of 651 college students, in a large state-funded university in Texas, found 34.5% of their students reported food insecurity in the month prior to the survey, with those indicating loss of income and changes in living situations due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the highest risk for food insecurity [25]. Interventions to address these concerns include expanding federal eligibility and benefit levels, simplifying the process for college students to enroll in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other public benefits, increasing access to financial aid, moving toward free college tuition, maintaining supplemental cost of living expenses to unemployment benefits, and/or implementing a universal basic income.\n\nDelays to graduation caused by the pandemic at institutions such as CUNY, which serves a high proportion of low-income and Black and Hispanic students, could further exacerbate existing economic disparities and social inequities. Implementation of new policies and programs to increase college student access to mental health services and public benefits can help to prevent these inequities from growing. Finally, while becoming infected with COVID-19 takes a toll on students and their loved ones physically, the mental health aspect of becoming infected or thinking one may be infected cannot be ignored. We found a substantial increase in students reporting their general health was poor or fair as a result of the pandemic.\n\nGo to:\nPublic health implications\nMuch of the public discussion of COVID-19 on campuses has emphasized the role of the pandemic on community transmission of infection [26]. However, the majority of US college students do not attend residential campuses but rather go to community colleges or local campuses and live at home with their families or peers [27]. As a population, CUNY students more resemble the majority of US college students than those attending private institutions with on-campus housing. Thus, preventing further increases to and mitigating the consequences of spikes in food and housing insecurity, depression, and anxiety among college students such as those at CUNY can contribute both to mitigating the effects of the pandemic and to achieving national health and equity goals.",

The COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has pushed global governments and communities to revisit the appropriate non-pharmaceutical health prevention measures in response to this unexpected virus outbreak.1 The World Health Organization (WHO) health emergency and disaster risk management (health-EDRM) framework refers to the structured analysis and management of health risks brought upon by emergencies and disasters and was developed based on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030. The framework focuses on prevention and risk mitigation through hazard and vulnerability reduction, preparedness, response and recovery measures2 and further calls attention to the significance of community involvement to counteract the potential negative impacts of hazardous events such as infectious disease outbreaks.2 While the framework does not provide details on event-specific prevention, it is well justified for primary prevention measures against COVID-19, which is defined as a biological hazard under the health-EDRM disaster classification.3 While there is evidence for potential COVID-19 droplet transmission,4 the WHO has suggested that airborne transmission may only be possible in certain circumstances4 and further evidence is needed to categorize it as an airborne disease specifically.\n\nHealth-EDRM prevention measures can be classified into primary, secondary or tertiary levels.5 Primary prevention mitigates the occurrence of illness through an emphasis on health promotion and education aimed at behavioural modification6; secondary prevention involves screening and infection identification; tertiary prevention focuses on treatment. In the context of COVID-19, both secondary and tertiary preventive measures are complicated due to the high incidence of asymptomatic patients,7 the lack of consensus and availability of specific treatment or vaccine8 and the added stress on the health system during a pandemic. Primary prevention that focuses on protecting an individual from contracting an infection9 is therefore the most practical option. A comprehensive disaster management cycle (prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery) encompasses both top-down and bottom-up measures.10,11 Top-down measures require well-driven bottom-up initiatives to successfully achieve primary prevention and effectively modify community behaviours.12 During and since the writing of this review, several landmark publications have studied and addressed the effect of non-pharmaceutical behavioural measures in preventing the transmission of COVID-19, generally concluding that while effectiveness and uptake of measures varied, behavioural change at personal and population levels is key to effectively control the spread of COVID-19.13–17 The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight the feasibility of implementing non-pharmaceutical preventive measures within a population facing an emergency, building on the health-EDRM framework, and theoretical aspects of behavioural change presented in other publications.\n\nBased on the health-EDRM framework, which emphasizes the impact of context on efficacy of measure practices,3 this article examines available published evidence on behavioural measures that might be adopted at the personal, household and community levels for droplet-borne transmitted diseases and enabling and limiting factors for each measure. Additionally, this article reviews the strength of available scientific evidence for each of the behavioural changes, which may reduce health risks.\n\nMethodology\nA literature search was conducted in May 2020. English language-based literature published between January 2000 and May 2020 were identified and included. Further literature was identified using the references of those already reviewed. Types of literature include international peer-reviewed articles, online reports, commentaries, editorials, electronic books and press releases from universities and research institutions, which include expert opinions. Grey literature published by the WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other local government publications and information outlets were also included. Literature that did not fulfil the criteria was excluded, for example peer-reviewed studies without English-language abstracts.\n\nResearch databases examined in this study included PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Medline and Science Direct. The keywords and phrases included in the initial search can be broadly categorized into three groups: those relating to the virus, including variations of COVID-19 nomenclature, or relevant to broader respiratory viruses (such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS’, ‘enveloped viruses’); those relating to general disease prevention and management (such as ‘transmission’, ‘risk management’) and those relating to primary prevention measures (such as ‘handwashing’, ‘coughing and sneezing’, ‘face masks’). The full list can be found in Appendix 1. Behavioural measures as well as risk factors for infectious disease transmission were reviewed in order to generate 10 common preventive measures for discussion. The avoidance of cutlery sharing, for example, was generated after determining it as a highly preventable risk for infectious disease transmission. Each primary prevention measure was summarized narratively according to the risk factors, co-benefits, enabling and limiting factors and strength of evidence. Three reviewers assessed the studies independently and agreed on the final research used.\n\nThe literature was categorized according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence (Fig. 1),18 which systemizes strength of evidence into levels, based on the process of study design and methodology. Three reviewers collectively engaged in and agreed on the final categorization.\n\nFig. 1\nThe Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence (adapted from www.cebm.net).18\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence (adapted from www.cebm.net).18\n\n\nNo new data were generated or analysed in support of this review.\n\nResults\nThe search identified 104 relevant publications, all of which were reviewed and included in the results analysis. The search identified and grouped 10 common bottom-up, non-pharmaceutical, primary prevention behavioural measures, based on the health-EDRM framework. The review of evidence is disaggregated into the 10 prevention measures.\n\nSix ‘personal’ protective practices (engage in regular handwashing, wear face mask, avoid touching the face, cover mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, bring personal utensils when dining out and close toilet cover when flushing), two ‘household’ practices (disinfect household surfaces and avoid sharing cutlery) and two ‘community’ practices (avoid crowds and mass gatherings and avoid travel) were identified. Tables 1–3 highlight the potential health risk, desired behavioural changes, potential health co-benefits, enabling and limiting factors and strength of evidence available in published literature with regard to these measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1(Part 1): Personal practices as preventive measure—risk; behavioural change; health co-benefits; enabling and limiting factors and strength of evidence\n \tEngage in regular handwashing\tWear face mask\tAvoid touching the face\nRisk \t\nCOVID-19 is transmittable through respiratory fluid droplets4,19\n\nDroplets can persist on hands and other surfaces20\n\nDroplets may be transferred if hands are not disinfected\n\n \t\nRespiratory droplets from other individuals and hand-to-face contacts can result in droplet intake through the nose and mouth4,21,22\n\nViruses have the potential to survive in the respiratory tract.23 The virus may also enter through ocular means, although studies focusing specifically on COVID-19 are limited24\n\nCOVID-19 has an incubation period of as long as 19 days25; asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals may spread the virus through coughing or sneezing\n\nIn 2010, WHO stated that where there is improper mask usage, risk may increase26\n\n \t\nRecent research has suggested that nasal carriage27 and ocular entry24 are key alternative routes to oral entry into the respiratory tract for COVID-19\n\nIt has been demonstrated that COVID-19 can be detected on surfaces of plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard for up to 72 hours20 after contamination.

The review results showed that ~68% of the studied literature was associated with personal practices, 13% with household practices and 19% with community practices. The measures of engaging in regular handwashing, wearing face masks as well as avoiding mass gatherings were among the most commonly studied preventive measures. Details of each utilized reference can be found in Appendix 2.\n\nDiscussion\nEvidence relating to 10 common health-EDRM behavioural measures for primary prevention against droplet-borne biological hazards were identified and reviewed. The information referenced here is based on best available evidence and will need to be updated as new studies and guidelines are published, and the understanding of the scientific community is enhanced. At the time of writing, there is an outstanding question as to whether COVID-19 is transmitted through droplet or aerosol in the community. Following the writing of this review, certain areas of evidence have evolved. On June 5, 2020, the WHO updated its official guidance to recommend that face masks be worn by the general public as a preventive measure against COVID-19 transmission.122 The WHO had previously recommended that masks be worn only by healthcare workers and people confirmed to have COVID-19, due to limited evidence that masks worn by health individuals may be effective as a prevention measure.123 The knowledge and consensus within the scientific community on COVID-19 continue to evolve at an unprecedented rate.\n\nAlthough direct evidence on the efficacy of COVID-19-specific prevention measures is lacking, largely due to the novelty of the disease, five behavioural measures were identified: regular handwashing, wearing face masks, avoiding touching of face, covering during sneezing or coughing and household disinfecting. Five other potential behavioural measures were also identified through logical deductions from potential behavioural risks associated with transmission of diseases similar to COVID-19.79 Utensil-related practices, in particular, were heavily limited in evidence to support their efficacy against viral infections.\n\nThe efficacy and success of the 10 bottom-up behavioural measures reviewed here are subject to specific enabling and limiting determinants, ranging from demographic (e.g. age, gender, education), socio-cultural, economic (e.g. financial accessibility to commodities) and knowledge (e.g. understanding of risk, equipment use). The viability and efficacy of each measure may be limited by determinants and constraints in different contexts. Resource-deprived areas may face constraints and reduced effectiveness of implementation, especially for measures that require preventive commodities such as face masks and household disinfectants. As such, special attention should be given to rural settings, informal settlements and resource-deficit contexts where access to information and resources such as clean water supply are often limited,124,125 and sanitation facilities are lacking.126 For hygiene measures, different alternatives should be promoted and their relative scientific merits should be evaluated, such as the use of ash as an alternative to soap for handwashing67 or the efficacy of handwashing with alcohol sanitizer, which has been demonstrated in previously published studies for H1N1127 and noroviruses128 but not yet concretely for COVID-19. Meanwhile, for measures that have no direct alternatives available, it is important for authorities and policymakers to understand the capacity limitations of certain target groups and provide additional support or put in place other preventive measures. In cases where material resources are scarce, the measures of awareness on sneezing and coughing etiquette as well as avoiding hand-to-face contact are the most convenient to adopt as they require little to no commodities. However, it should be well noted that these measures are likely the most challenging in compliance and enforceability, as they rely on the modification of frequent and natural human behaviours whose modifications would require awareness and practice.50,51 Furthermore, these can be challenging to implement in target groups with less capacity for health literacy and translation of education into practice, such as infants and elderly suffering from dementia. Cultural patterns can be associated with behavioural intentions. In the case of avoiding utensil-sharing during meals, enforcing change may be conflicted with cultural and traditional norms in Asia and certain European communities.129\n\nOf the enabling factors documented for each proposed measure, shared enablers can be identified: accessibility and affordability of resources; related knowledge, awareness and understanding of risk; and associated top-down policy facilitation. Majority of personal and household practices heavily rely on access to resources, such as adequate water and soap supply for regular handwashing, quality face masks and household disinfectants. Various theories of the ‘Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices’ model have assumed that individual knowledge enhancement will lead to positive behavioural changes.130 Health measures targeting mask wearing might aim to enhance (i) the individual’s risk perception, knowledge and awareness on protection effectiveness of masks, and how to properly wear a mask so that the prevention is most effective; (ii) an individual or community’s attitude towards the pr",

However, concerns exist regarding the long-term adverse effects cocooning may have on their physical and mental health.\n\nAim\nTo examine health trajectories and healthcare utilization while cocooning in a cohort of community-dwelling people aged ≥70 years.\n\nDesign\nSurvey of 150 patients (55% female, mean age 80 years and mean Clinical Frailty Scale Score 4.8) attending ambulatory medical services in a large urban university hospital.\n\nMethods\nThe survey covered four broad themes: access to healthcare services, mental health, physical health and attitudes to COVID-19 restrictions. Survey data were presented descriptively.\n\nResults\nAlmost 40% (59/150) reported that their mental health was ‘worse’ or ‘much worse’ while cocooning, while over 40% (63/150) reported a decline in their physical health. Almost 70% (104/150) reported exercising less frequently or not exercising at all. Over 57% (86/150) of participants reported loneliness with 1 in 8 (19/150) reporting that they were lonely ‘very often’. Half of participants (75/150) reported a decline in their quality of life. Over 60% (91/150) agreed with government advice for those ≥70 years but over 40% (61/150) reported that they disliked the term ‘cocooning’.\n\nConclusions\nGiven the likelihood of further restrictions in coming months, clear policies and advice for older people around strategies to maintain social engagement, manage loneliness and continue physical activity and access timely medical care and rehabilitation services should be a priority.\n\nTopic: physical activityexercisefrailtyattitudegovernmenthospitals, universitymental healthlonelinessquality of liferehabilitationphysical healtholder adulthealth care usecommunitysocial engagementlong term adverse effectscovid-19coronavirus pandemic\nIssue Section: Original Paper\nIntroduction\nIn terms of morbidity and mortality, COVID-19 disproportionately affects frail, older people. Older people with COVID-19 are more likely to develop severe respiratory illness1 and delirium.2 In Ireland, almost 80% of deaths from COVID-19 have involved people aged ≥75 years3 and the crude mortality proportion in people aged 70–79 years with COVID-19 is almost 23%, rising to almost 30% in those aged ≥80 years.4\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19, in late March 2020 all people aged ≥70 years (as well as some younger people with underlying health conditions) in Ireland were advised to stay at home and reduce face-to-face interaction with other people as much as possible.3 Older people were advised to stay indoors, have groceries and medicines delivered and avoid contact with friends and family in order to minimize spread within a high-risk group, delay peaks in case numbers and relieve pressure on health services. The term most commonly used to describe this strategy of self-isolation in Ireland was ‘cocooning’,5 however alternative terms such as shielding or sheltering have also been used to describe similar strategies involving older populations in other countries.6,7 Cocooning recommendations remain in place at this current time, but there have been some relaxations since they were introduced, involving for example, that shopping is now allotted to designated hours and support bubbles for those living alone are now recommended.\n\nSocial isolation, an inevitable consequence of cocooning for many older people, can have a profound impact longitudinally on health in later life. Indeed, socially isolated older people are more likely to report loneliness8 and disturbed sleep,9 have a higher likelihood of developing depression and psychological distress,10 engage in less physical activity and more sedentary time,11 demonstrate unhealthy behaviors in general12 and have premature mortality.13\n\nOther potential consequences of cocooning, including increased sedentary behavior and lack of physical exercise,14 reduction in leisure activities15 and restricted access to important services can also adversely affect health in later life.16\n\nTherefore, while cocooning forms an important part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with an overall aim to prevent transmission to vulnerable older people, concerns exist regarding the long-term adverse effects it may have on their physical and mental health. The aim of this study was to examine trajectories of physical and mental health, access to important services and activities and healthcare utilization while cocooning in a cohort of community-dwelling people aged ≥70 years attending ambulatory services in a large university teaching hospital.\n\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design and setting\nA questionnaire was administered to community-dwelling older people attending older person-specific ambulatory care services in a large teaching hospital.\n\nSt James’s Hospital is a large urban teaching hospital with a well-developed ambulatory care service for older people. Participants were recruited from general medicine for the older person clinics, the day hospital service and falls and syncope clinics.\n\nThis was a convenience sample, with older people attending ambulatory services approached between October 2020 and December 2020.\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\nParticipants were included if they were aged ≥70 years, had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 or admitted to hospital since March 2020 and were able to give informed consent to complete the questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered by healthcare professionals seeing the participant in the respective ambulatory care setting.\n\nQuestionnaire\nAs well as collecting basic demographic information, the questionnaire covered four broad themes:\n\nAccess to essential services, particularly healthcare services, while cocooning during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTrend in mental health while cocooning during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTrend in physical health while cocooning during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCompliance with and attitude to advice regarding cocooning during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS, version 2.0) was also completed on all participants.17 See Supplementary Material for a copy of the questionnaire.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analysed using Stata version 14.1 (StataCorp. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP; 2015).\n\nSurvey data was presented descriptively as means with 95% confidence intervals and percentages. Chi-square test was used to test for differences between categorical variables.\n\nEthics\nThe study was approved by the Tallaght University Hospital and St James’s Hospital Research Ethics Committee (Reference 2020-10).\n\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nAlmost 55% (82/150) of participants were female, and the mean age was 79.8 years (95% CI 78.8–80.8).\n\nOver half (78/150) of participants were married; 39% (59/150) were widowed; 8% (12/150) were single and 1% (1/150) were cohabiting. Almost half (72/150) of participants lived with a spouse or partner; 38% (57/150) lived alone while 14% (21/150) lived with family other than a spouse or partner or a friend/colleague.\n\nThe mean CFS was 4.8 (95% CI 4.6–5.0). Thirteen percent of participants (19/150) had a CFS ≤3 indicating that they were fit or managing well; 37% (55/150) had a CFS = 4 indicating very mild frailty; one fifth had a CFS =5 (28/150) indicating mild frailty and a CFS =6 (30/150) indicating moderate frailty, respectively, while the remaining 12% (18/150) had a CFS ≥7 indicating severe or very severe frailty.\n\nAccess to healthcare\nOver 57% (86/150) of participants had a scheduled healthcare-related visit cancelled while cocooning. The most frequently cancelled service was hospital outpatient appointments, with one third (50/150) of participants reporting a cancelled appointment.\n\nAlmost 1 in 6 participants reported that while cocooning they did not seek medical attention for an illness, when they otherwise would have done so. Half of those who did not seek medical attention (12/150) said this was because they were afraid of catching COVID-19 while 46% (11/150) cited a lack of the service through which they would usually access healthcare as the reason for not seeking medical attention when unwell.\n\nMental health\nAlmost 40% (59/150) of participants reported that their mental health was worse or much worse since the start of cocooning, while 57% (86/150) reported no change in their mental health and 3% (5/150) reported an improvement in their mental health since they were advised to cocoon (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1.\nSelf-reported trends in QOL, physical and mental health while cocooning.

Seventy percent (105/150) of participants reported low mood at least some of the time, with 12% (18/150) reporting low mood ‘very often’.\n\nParticipants were almost twice as likely to report loneliness if they lived alone (47% vs. 27%; X2 = 6.20; P = 0.013).\n\nPhysical health\nOver 40% (63/150) of participants reported a decline in their physical health since cocooning, while 55% (82/150) reported no change in their physical health and 3% (5/150) reported an improvement in their physical health status (Figure 1).\n\nOf those reporting a decline in physical health, one third (21/63) reported not leaving the house at all while cocooning, compared to 10% (9/87) of those who did not report a decline in physical health (X2 = 12.07; P = 0.001).\n\nFigure 3 demonstrates the changes in physical health parameters reported by participants while cocooning.\n\nFigure 3.\nSelf-reported change in physical health parameters while cocooning.

Participants were asked: How would you say your mobility/fitness/energy levels/sleep/diet has changed while you were cocooning? Is it Much Better, Better, Same/No Change, Worse or Much Worse?\n\n\nAlmost 40% (59/150) reported a decline in their mobility since cocooning, with 8% (12/150) reporting their mobility was ‘much worse’. Over one third (56/150) felt their physical fitness had declined and almost half (70/150) of participants reported lower energy levels since beginning cocooning. Almost one third (43/150) reported a decline in the quality of their sleep and one fifth (29/150) reported a worse diet.\n\nQuality of life\nHalf of participants (75/150) reported a decline in their quality of life (QOL) while cocooning. Three percent (4/150) reported an improved QOL, while the remaining participants (71/150) noted no change in their QOL. Almost 10% (13/150) reported that their QOL was ‘much worse’ than prior to the pandemic (Figure 1).\n\nQOL was more likely to decline in those who also reported a decline in mental health (X2 = 17.46; P < 0.001) and physical health (X2 = 33.52, P < 0.001) or who reported loneliness (X2 = 10.90; P = 0.001). There was no association between poorer QOL and living alone (X2 = 1.39; P = 0.239), family visiting less frequently (X2 = 1.32; P = 0.251) or QOL and not leaving the house at all while cocooning (X2 = 0.67; P = 0.414).\n\nAttitudes to and compliance with COVID-19 restrictions\nOver half (81/150) of participants reported seeing their family members less frequently since being advised to cocoon. Three percent (5/150) reported seeing their families more during this time.\n\nOne in five (30/150) reported not leaving their house at all since being advised to cocoon, while over 60% (92/150) left the house less often and a further one in five (28/150) reported leaving the house as frequently as before.\n\nOver half (79/150) of participants reported not seeing friends or colleagues at all since being advised to cocoon, while a further 38% (57/150) saw friends less frequently. Less than 1 in 10 reported seeing friends as frequently as before.\n\nOne-quarter of participants (41/150) reported not exercising at all, 42% (63/150) reported exercising less frequently than before, 29% (43/150) reported exercising the same amount of time, while 2% (3/150) reported exercising more frequently while cocooning.\n\nOver 60% (91/150) reported not using public transports at all, while one third (51/150) reported not doing grocery shopping at all since being advised to cocoon.\n\nOne quarter (39/150) of participants reported that they did not agree with the government advice regarding cocooning. Almost 17% (25/150) strongly agreed with cocooning, 44% (66/150) agreed and 13% (20/150) reported that they neither agreed nor disagreed with the government advice.\n\nThere was no association between reported loneliness (X2 = 1.99; P = 0.158), decline in mental health (X2 = 0.07; P = 0.786) or decline in physical health (X2 = 0.01; P = 0.941) with the level of agreement with advice to cocoon. There was also no association between the frequency of times participants left the house while cocooning and reported agreement with cocooning advice (X2 = 0.25; P = 0.616).\n\nOver 40% (61/150) of participants reported that they disliked the term ‘cocooning’ however, while almost 10% (14/150) reported that they liked the term.\n\nOver half (77/150) of participants were not in favor of ‘virtual’ clinics over the telephone or via video call, while one quarter (38/150) were in favor of such clinics.\n\nDiscussion\nThe study involved a convenience sample of older adults attending specialist ambulatory medical services who were not acutely unwell and examined changes in their physical and mental health while cocooning during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored the effect the pandemic has had on their access to healthcare, as well as the compliance to and attitudes toward COVID-19 restrictions amongst this cohort.\n\nSelf-reported mental health declined significantly while cocooning. We found that 2 in 5 participants reported a decline in their mental health overall, with 70% reporting low mood at least some of the time and 12% reporting low mood very often. Three in five participants reported loneliness and loneliness was twice as prevalent in those living alone than those living with spouses or other family members.\n\nThese findings are consistent with other studies demonstrating a decline in mental health amongst older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the UK Household Longitudinal Study, the prevalence of clinically significant mental distress rose from 11% to 18% from 2018–19, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to April 2020 amongst participants aged ≥70 years.18 In Ireland, perceived stress amongst adults aged ≥60 years increased by 20% post-pandemic.19 Pre-existing health conditions, high estimates of personal risk and time spent quarantining, all of which are more prevalent in those aged ≥ 70 years, appear to be independent risk factors for depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.20,21\n\nAdditionally, over 40% of participants reported a decline in their physical health while cocooning. Participants reporting a decline in physical health were three times more likely to also report not leaving the house at all since being advised to cocoon. Almost 40% of participants noted a decline in their mobility and 40% reported having lower levels of fitness while cocooning. Almost half of those surveyed reported lower energy levels and over one quarter reported poorer sleep while cocooning. Half of participants reported a decline in QOL.\n\nGiven the constraints imposed by cocooning on social interaction and physical activity, these findings are not necessarily surprising. Maintenance of social engagement is strongly associated with better self-reported health status and lower burden of depressive symptoms in later life22 while physical activity is associated with better mental health,23 QOL24 and better health trajectories in general.25 A period of 3 months detraining in older adults who previously exercised regularly is associated with a significant decline in standing balance, gait and QOL for example.26\n\nDespite these poorer health trajectories while cocooning, over 60% of participants agreed with government advice regarding cocooning and there was a high degree of reported compliance with this advice, even amongst those who also reported declining physical or mental health. Worryingly, one in six participants also reported that they avoided seeking medical attention when unwell while cocooning, with concern regarding contracting COVID-19 or inability to access appropriate clinical pathways cited as common reasons.\n\nThere are some limitations to this study that should be noted. While participants were asked about health trajectories it is beyond the scope of the study to determine if decline in health status was directly related to cocooning or for other reasons but participants who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or those who were admitted to hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded. All participants were surveyed while in a healthcare setting, and responses regarding compliance with government advice and attitudes to COVID-19 restrictions must be interpreted in this context, as for example, it is possible that some may have been reluctant to report non-compliance in this context. Further, all measures of health are by self-report only and further studies with objective health measures would therefore be welcome. The strengths of this study include the fact that it involves a sample of older adults attending ambulatory medical services and therefore with relatively high rates of frailty and comorbid disease. Surveys were completed face-to-face, rather than online or virtually and to the authors knowledge, this is the first study conducted on a clinical sample of older adults who did not contract COVID-19 regarding health trajectories while cocooning or shielding.\n\nThese findings highlight the potential secondary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older people. While cocooning or shielding reduces the likelihood of older people contracting COVID-19, there may be important adverse impacts on the health of those who cocoon that need to be addressed. Given the likelihood of further waves of COVID-19 in coming months, with the possibility of further restrictions despite the rollout of vaccines, clear policies and advice for older people around strategies to maintain social engagement, manage loneliness, continue physical activity and avoid deferring the need for medical attention when unwell should be a priority, as well as a focus on provision of appropriate rehabilitation services for this cohort.",

It includes key trends and developments in the\npartner countries covered by the European Training Foundation1\n.\nAll countries in the EU Neighbourhood and Central Asia have been hit by the COVID-19\noutbreak to a greater or lesser extent, with overall lower infection numbers compared to\nsome of the EU Member States, although issues of under-reporting may impact on the\nreliability of data. All countries, apart from Belarus and Turkmenistan, made similar decisions\nas regards their education and training systems, including closing schools and training\nproviders as well as shifting to distance digital learning tools and preparing teachers and\ntrainers to use them. Nevertheless, measures adopted in the economic field have been\ndiverse - from full lock down, which was in place in several countries for several weeks, to\npartial limitations, constrained working hours and restrictions applied in certain sectors of the\neconomy. The result of these measures on the socio-economic status of the EU\nneighbourhood and Central Asian countries have been quite similar. In May 2020, many\ncountries gradually began to lift restrictions, but overall, economic recovery will need to wait\nuntil 2021, assuming the second half of 2020 will not bring additional stress on already fragile\neconomic and social issues. Businesses and consumers remain prudent and a V-shaped\neconomic recovery is rather unlikely. Expectations and estimations vary from diverse\ninstitutional sources, increasing the level of uncertainty about the pace and type of economic\nrecovery that will occur worldwide.\nThe GDP forecast for 2020 is a moving target, as fears of a second wave of infections and\nnew restrictions may hamper economic recovery in the second part of the year. In April 2020,\nthe International Monetary Fund made the following estimates about the GDP change in the\nETF partner countries:\n1 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, Armenia,\nAzerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon,\nMorocco, Palestine*, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan\nSource: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2020\nUpdated projections in June 2020 show worsening GDP estimates for many economies. The\nOECD reviewed GDP contraction estimates considering two scenarios – one in which a\nmajor new outbreak is avoided (single hit scenario) and one in which a new surge in\ninfections strikes the economic recovery again (double hit scenario). Selected available data\nfrom the OECD show a deep impact worldwide. In the ETF partner countries for which\nestimates are available, a second wave will lead to a further drop in GDP projections from –\n6.1% to –8.3% in Israel, from –8% to –10% in Russia and from –4.8% to –8.1% in Turkey.\nThe exports of goods and services will also drop in 2020 compared to the previous year by\nan average of 24.3% in the EU Candidate Countries2\n; 16.5% in Russia and 6.3% in MENA\ncountries3 (EC Spring Forecast, 2020). The neighbourhood countries are particularly\nexposed as for many of them, EU countries are major trading partners with a significant\nshare in total exports.\nIn this report, we are looking at seven critical factors as a basis for analysing the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 in the EU neighbourhood and Central Asian countries in\nterms of skills development and future economic recovery. Three of them are considered risk\nfactors, likely to negatively influence the future of economies, increase demands for social\nservices and subsistence-based solutions far beyond the immediate emergency response.\nThe other four are considered emerging opportunity factors, which nevertheless, pose\ndemands on how far countries can maximize them to boost and accelerate the gap created\nby COVID-19.\n2 Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey\n3 Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman,\nUnited Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar\n-5 -5.1\n-1.4-2.1\n-5.9 -5\n1.9\n-3.9\n-6.2\n-3.7-2.5\n-5 -4\n-12\n-3\n-8.9\n-3.7 -4\n-5.4\n-3\n1\n-4.2-4.9\n1.8\n-7.7\n1.8\n-13\n-11\n-9\n-7\n-5\n-3\n-1\n1\n3\nGross domestic product (GDP), constant prices, 2020\n(%)\nRisk factors\nIncreasing unemployment. All countries are facing an unexpected and sudden increase in\nunemployment. Many have lost in a couple of months what they had gained over several\nyears. Estimates on employment and unemployment levels in 2020 reveal a strong\ndepreciation in the EU candidate countries, with lowered employment rates of over 3\npercentage points in Albania and Serbia; while the total unemployment rate is expected to\nincrease in all candidate countries by around 2 – 3 percentage points. Similar trends are\nobserved in other regions. In Egypt unemployment increased by 0.8 percentage points, in\nMorocco the increase in the COVID months has been of 1.4 percentage points, losing the\nboost achieved in the last months of 2019, in Tunisia unemployment went up to 15.1% in the\nmonths of lockdown.\nThe sectoral pattern of the impact of the pandemic is rather similar across countries. Sectors\nsuch as tourism, restaurants and catering, transportation, car manufacturing, retail, fuel\nproduction and distribution and culture were hit heavily. Oil and gas exporting countries have\nbeen highly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, as have countries dependent on\ninternational trade. Small and medium sized enterprises have been most affected, and they\nabsorb a greater number of employees in most ETF partner countries. Naturally, troubles in\none sector have triggered domino effects in others as, for example, in line with the collapse\nof hotels, restaurants and catering activities, the demand for food production and distribution\nhas gone down. The same applies to aviation and fuel consumption. As recovery signs are\nstill modest, major risks are a huge exit from the market of micro, small and possibly medium\nsized enterprises, leading to job losses or at best, shortened working hours in many sectors.\nIncreased poverty and inequalities. Socio-economic effects in most countries are a\ncompound of diverse trigger factors and underlying causes, old and new. This is against a\nbackdrop of fragile public budgets and low or no fiscal room for manoeuvre in many\ncountries. Most countries of the EU neighbourhood and Central Asia region have faced\nsimilar consequences for their most disadvantaged groups. As an effect of the crisis there\nare more people falling into vulnerable groups, such as informal workers, returning migrants,\nrefugees, young graduates and jobseekers, the elderly and low skilled workers. Poverty is\nlikely to grow in many countries. In Lebanon for example the World Bank had projected that\n40% of Lebanese people would be in poverty by the end of 2020, a forecast which the\neconomy minister believes is now outdated. One in three Moroccans may potentially fall into\nthe ‘poor’ category. In most Central Asian countries informality represents the norm in the\nprivate sector4\n, and high informality in the labour market is a characteristic of many countries\nin the EU neighbourhood as well. Informal workers are less likely to access to social support\nas well as forms of social protection. Remittances, an important component of GDP in many\ncountries, have dropped because of increased unemployment and reduction of wages of the\nmigrant workers. In countries heavily dependent on remittances, such as Moldova, Tajikistan\nand Kyrgyzstan for example, this will impact directly on poor and externally dependent\nhouseholds. Also, the lack of jobs is likely to generate a flow of returning migrants. These are\ngoing to impact on the demand for health services, social protection and local employment,\nposing additional challenges for the already fragile socio-economic situation. The impact of\n4 In Tajikistan only 13% of employment in the private sector is formal (OECD 2020)\nthe pandemic is worse in countries already experiencing huge inflows of refugees and\ndisplaced people, such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.\nAlso, movement restrictions affected commuters and company closures have left many\nfamilies without a decent means of living. Similarly, groups exposed to poverty and social\nexclusion, including members of ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, do not have\nsufficient resources/savings to weather the financial toll of crisis. Many children with certain\ntypes of disability, particularly mental, had no or limited access to education and social\nsupport during the peak period of health crisis and restrictions.\nYoung graduates and young jobseekers who already faced difficulties entering the labour\nmarket, reflected in the high youth unemployment rates in the Neighbourhood region, are\nnow at even greater risk, as countries have frozen apprenticeship programmes and other\nforms of support to young graduates. In many countries, the graduate generation of 2020 has\nmissed out on most practical training and work-based learning opportunities due to the\nsuspension of such forms of education and work experience. Weaker demand and more\nprudent hiring strategies may limit their employment opportunities over the medium-term.\nFurthermore, older workers, workers with insufficient digital skills and those working in the\nmost affected economic sectors are at risk of losing their jobs if reskilling and upskilling does\nnot take place swiftly enough as new demands emerge.\nIncreased polarisation. The urban and rural divide has played a major role in how COVID19 has influenced different communities. In general, schools, teachers and pupils from rural\nareas were less prepared to move to online education due to poor digital infrastructure\n(IT/communication connectivity) and had less resources to invest in communication devices,\nand insufficient digital skills in many cases. Spikes in health and social protection\nexpenditure have jeopardised investments in human capital development, infrastructure\ndevelopment, and plans made by countries for innovation and transition to green economies.\nIt is hard to fully quantify the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 while the pandemic still\nunfolds and with little clarity as to when it will end. Projections on the recovery of the global\neconomy range from one to four years; some countries will weather the effects better than\nothers. It is clear however, that countries with significant proportions of inactive and\nunemployed people exposed to poverty, are less resilient and may experience a lengthier\nrecovery. The risk of extreme social polarisation is higher than ever.\nAs the crisis affected societies as a whole on an unprecedented scale, the biggest risk is\nfailing to cater sufficiently for vulnerable groups. Regardless of the definition or categorisation\nof people or groups at social risk across countries, significant numbers of people remain\nexposed to poverty and social exclusion in the ETF partner countries. Volatile economies,\nlimited job prospects and tight public budgets might worsen their fate.\nThe general assumption is that once the restrictions are eased or scraped, economic\ndemand could rebound leading to a swifter recovery in certain economic sectors or entire\neconomies. However, in the absence of an efficient antidote or vaccine, restricted movement\nof people and precautionary health protection measures are likely to continue to limit tourism,\ntransportation, culture, creative and entertainment industries and affect the overall demand\nfor products and services. Health-related restrictions also challenge the way education and\ntraining services are delivered, calling for long-term, systemic adaptation of education\nsystems and increased digitalisation and blended learning.\nWhile the overall socio-economic picture brings enormous challenges for all countries,\nputting at risk enrolment rates and dropouts, even increased informality and deterioration of\nsocial and labour conditions, there are also opportunities emerging that should be captured\nto inform policy choices for more resilient socio-economic ecosystems.\nOpportunity Factors\nEmerging sectors and digitalisation. Opportunities emerged in the Information Technology\nand Communication sector, including electronic device production and distribution. This is\ndue to unprecedented reliance on ICT solutions in education and health services,\nmanufacturing, and trade. The outbreak has in fact accelerated the digital transition of\ndifferent sectors of the economy and individuals. Large proportions of services, including\nworking and learning, have moved online.\nSome manufacturing companies have quickly adapted to the surge in demand for health\nproducts, and personal protection equipment, as did some technical and vocational training\ncentres which joined the production effort. ‘Re-shoring’, re-localisation of industries and\nshorter production chains are being looked at by governments and business sector in the\nEuropean Union and neighbourhood region. Human capital policies should support\n(re)building the skill sets needed for (re)emerging economic branches.\nStrengthening public and private sector cooperation. The COVID-19 has given new\nimpetus to start ups and attention to promoting innovative ideas through hackathons in\nseveral countries as well as internationally. The EUvsVirus hackathon alone, organised by\nthe European Commission in April 2020 and with the participation of several ETF partner\ncountries, has succeeded in promoting more than 400 projects to support transformation as a\nconsequence of COVID-19. In almost all countries these kinds of initiative have flourished,\ngiving new space to entrepreneurship as well as collaboration among stakeholders. Such a\npositive trend in the cooperation and partnership between the public and private sector has\nnever been seen before. The emergency, as well as the need to move quickly to realise and\nmarket specific services and products, has led to this increase in cooperation. This also\napplies to skills and training, where the private sector has played an essential role in\nsupporting public policy decisions such as the shift to distance digital learning and ensuring\nbusiness continuity for essential services.\nNew forms of work arising. Companies active in the service sector, public administration\nand education systems have prioritised online modes of work or service delivery. This has\ncaused a surge in demand for online communication solutions, co-working platforms,\nsoftware and hardware investment etc. It has also led to a higher demand for a specialised,\noften younger, workforce to deal with the digitalisation of working environments. Widespread\nworking from home may also offer opportunities for increasing female employment or\nengagement in business activities in many countries where traditional/cultural norms still limit\nwomen’s employment (although for many, lockdown exacerbated household and childcare\nobligations as well as exposure to domestic violence).\nA prominent issue across many countries, is the propensity for emigration of young\ngraduates and younger generations in general. The social toll of COVID-19 reflected in lost\njobs and lower income may exacerbate such trends once travel restrictions are eased and\neconomic activity fully resumes in the destination countries. A more preventive approach to\nemigration, particularly brain and skill drain, is constrained by deep differentials in earnings \nand quality or diversity of job opportunities between origin and destination countries, the\nlatter being mostly EU members with more advanced economies. A digitalised economy that\nhelps spread employment opportunities without physical borders and new investment and\njobs created through re-shoring/localising production closer to the EU may incentivise young\npeople (but not only), to look for employment opportunities or start-up businesses in their\nhome countries. Evidence to further to assess this dimension is yet to come, as countries are\nfacing now an adjustment after months of lockdown and restrictions. It is yet to be seen how\nlabour regulations, workers unions and employers will build on this experience to envisage a\nfuture of work that takes into account the opportunities of distance and smart working on the\ngreening of economies and inclusion. It is also important to ensure adequate protection and\nregulation so as not to risk further informality or precarious labour conditions dressed up with\na smart, green job name. Issues of family and work life conciliation, new or adapted social\ndialogue mechanisms and workers’ representation or skills upgrading need consideration in\nthe context of new forms of work.\nWider access to social protection and employment services, including better\ncoverage of informal workers.\nRegistration of informal workers: While we highlighted above the challenges faced by\ninformal workers across EU neighbourhood and Central Asian countries, it is important to\nbear in mind the necessity to ensure access to social benefits for all households, through\nonline registration. This should include informal workers, which, in the long run will lead to a\nmuch better picture of the problems at stake. To mitigate the impact on un-organised work\nforces, such as that in Egypt or Armenia, financial incentives have been offered to encourage\ninformal workers to register on an online database of the Ministry of Manpower.\nEasing access to employment services and social benefits: In Ukraine the government\nintroduced a number of legislative changes, that simplified the conditions for registration with\nthe employment services. They succeeded in reducing the time between the acceptance of a\nrequest and the delivery of a subsidy from 91 days to only one. A similar process of\nsimplification to apply for social benefits was implemented in Kazakhstan. Furthermore,\nmany countries have built on the COVID-19 restrictions to open up or strengthen egovernance, including online registration to services and application for social benefits,\naccess to administrative services as well as access to online resources including offering elearning platforms and services.\nImproving labour market information systems: The emerging informality that has been\ntracked through registration and access to social benefits allows countries to identify\nphenomena that they have been trying to address to date without sufficient evidence. This\nevidence, together with data obtained on the impact of COVID on formal labour markets,\naccess to smart working and other forms of flexible working arrangements, access to digital\neducational services, and other social data obtained in this period, can provide an\nunprecedented opportunity to analyse issues and build scenarios for policy choice and\norientation. More than ever before, there is an opportunity to rethink and shape the agenda\nfor the next decades, strengthening labour market information systems, governance of social\nsectors and building on technological opportunities including block chain and big data tools to\nshape policies for the future. \nBoth the risks and the opportunities put demands on skills development and lifelong learning.\nIn fact, they highlight the need to invest in skills in education and training institutions, in\ncompanies, as well as in promoting a lifelong learning approach in all countries.\nHow countries reacted\nBeyond immediate health protection measures, all countries in the EU Neighbourhood have\nadopted measures and programmes to ease the negative socio-economic impact of the\npandemic and support the stabilisation of economies.\nAs in many other countries and regions around the globe, the instant and devastating effects\nof lockdown and restrictions called for immediate policy actions mainly focused on keeping\nbusinesses afloat and safeguarding jobs. Next, countries have prioritised social protection\nmeasures such as increasing unemployment benefits, pensions and social assurance (noncontributory) benefits or expanding the coverage of the social protection systems, in a few\ncases this means covering returning migrants or workers in informal contexts.\nOut of the general set of active labour market measures, many countries prioritised\nemployment subsidies (e.g. tax or social contribution relief) or subsidies to companies to\nencourage them to keep workers. Many public employment services (PESs) are faced with a\nsignificant inflow of registered jobseekers against the backdrop of already weak capacity to\ndeal with pre-crisis unemployment levels (in many countries the ratio of PES advisers to\nunemployed is extremely high).\nUpskilling and reskilling measures are also rather weakly represented in crisis responses.\nThis is justified as during the first phases of crisis and lockdown, health, income loss and\neconomic blockages were the major risks. With the gradual lifting of restrictions and\nresumption of economic activity, although still not at full capacity or potential, it becomes\nclear that certain economic sectors, production and trade patterns and general demand for\nworkforce will not go back to pre-COVID-19 normality and it will probably change quite\ndramatically.\nThis section provides an overview of key measures for safeguarding companies and\nworkers, protecting the most vulnerable and preparing the ground for the relaunch of the\neconomy. Although upskilling/reskilling or other workforce adaptability measures have\nfeatured in some countries, human capital development responses have been somewhat\nweaker in the EU Neighbourhood regions. The coverage, as well as impact, of these\nmeasures is yet to be verified. As for the education and training response, so far we only\nknow the actions that have been carried out. These confirm that all countries have intervened\nin all areas at risk, although opportunities have perhaps not yet been fully grasped and the\nstrategic role that skills can play in ensuring a quick and sustainable future has not yet been\nfully understood.\nA. Support to companies and workers\nIn general, countries have focused on rapid public interventions to prevent the destruction of\nenterprises and huge job losses. Actions have included large stabilisation packages,\nexpanding public borrowing limits and providing liquidity to enterprises through access to\ncredit and guarantee schemes, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular. It\nhas also involved temporary exemption from payment of taxes and/or social insurance \ncontributions. The fiscal effects of such measures are still to be assessed and compensatory\nbudget measures may affect the consolidation pathways of many countries.\nThe types and intensity of measures differ from country to country depending on economic\nstructure, most exposed companies or sectors and national and external financial resources\nto support such programmes. Below are some highlights from each region.\nSouth Eastern Europe and Turkey\nThe government of Albania adopted a financial package to provide social support for citizens\nand companies targeting small businesses once economic activity ceased. Both employees\nand the self-employed benefitted. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the EBRD is a major partner\nto SME support and is working with intermediaries to restructure existing loans to SMEs to\nkeep them afloat, including adjusting repayment schedules. Also, they are reinforcing their\nadvisory services with greater emphasis on online advisory support for SMEs, and\nparticularly to ones owned by women. The government of North Macedonia initiated a\nsupport programme for companies and workers by subsidising contributions for employees of\ncompanies in the tourism, transport and catering sectors along with other affected\ncompanies. The National Bank has promoted more favourable credit standards for\ncompanies affected by the crisis and eased the standards for household and corporate loan\nrestructuring. In Montenegro, payment of taxes and contributions on salaries has been\npostponed and new credit lines were made available to improve the availability of liquidity for\nentrepreneurs, micro, small, medium and large enterprises, targeting the most affected\nsectors. A wage subsidy has also been put in place for the months of April, May and June\n2020 for companies in the tourism, transport and hospitality sectors. Kosovo5 has adopted a\nstabilisation and support programme targeting companies and workers at risk of being fired\nor those working in the most exposed sectors during pandemic (e.g. health sector, food\ndistribution etc.). The plan includes covering two months’ salary for employees; providing\ntop-ups to employees in essential sectors and offering financial liquidity for micro-enterprises,\nthe self-employed and business organisations/companies providing basic services. Turkey\nhas launched a stimulus package (Economic Stability Shield) to tackle the pandemic. It\nincludes reducing interest rates, tax breaks and deferrals, along with credit guarantees and\ndelays in loan repayments. Social security premiums will be deferred by six months for the\nretail, iron and steel industries, shopping malls, automotive, entertainment and hospitality\nsectors, food and beverage businesses, textiles as well as events organisation. In cases\nwhere weekly hours of work have been significantly reduced, or where activity in the\nworkplace is partially or totally terminated, it is possible to apply to ISKUR (Public\nEmployment Service of Turkey) for the payment of a short-working time allowance. In\nSerbia, the government will pay a minimum monthly salary to every employee of a micro,\nsmall and medium sized enterprise for a period of three months, covering more than 900,000\npeople. The government has also announced guarantee schemes for loans for the\nmaintenance of liquidity and working capital for small business owners, SMEs and\nagricultural enterprises. The payment of payroll taxes and contributions will be deferred.\nTourism, transport and logistics are the hardest hit. The Investment-Development Fund\n5 This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the\nKosovo declaration of independence.\noffers working capital loans to companies in the sector of medical supplies, tourism and\nhospitality, and food processing.\nEastern Partnership and Russia\nThe government of Armenia will pay a grant equal to the cost of the salary of every fifth\nemployee to companies with up to 100 employees that have retained their jobs since the\nCovid-19 crisis began. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and social partners have\ninitiated amendments to the Labour Code to regulate labour relations during the state of\nemergency. Three main types of measure to support companies are in place: 1) subsidized\n2-3 year loans to provide support to affected companies and SMEs; 2) direct subsidies to\nSMEs to help them to maintain their staff/ employees; (iii) grants to entrepreneurs and\ncompanies. Georgia will waive income tax for six months for employers retaining jobs during\npandemic. Moldova is putting similar measures in place, applying a six-month deferral of tax\npayments, reduced interest rates and additional liquidity to banks. A reduced VAT rate for the\nhospitality, restaurant and catering sector is also in place, as is some assistance for business\ncontinuity (full or partial reimbursement of payroll taxes) for companies forced to close. In\nUkraine, small and medium-sized employers who have stopped or reduced their activities\ncan receive partial unemployment benefits to cover the cost of wages for workers whose\nworking hours have been reduced. Other initiatives include measures to save jobs, simplify\naccess to finance through the guarantee of new loans and launching grant programmes,\nreducing business costs by refinancing loans and reducing the tax load. In Azerbaijan, the\ngovernment has allocated over 11 million USD to the tourism industry to cover the salaries of\nthe workers. Tax concessions and business support measures have also been applied.\nSMEs in the Russia have been badly hit by the COVID-19 situation. The Ministry of\nEconomic Development announced an anti-crisis package for small and medium-sized\nbusinesses and is helping the industries most affected by the outbreak. Companies mostly\nbenefited from tax breaks, direct subsidies to pay salaries as well as a reduction in employee\ninsurance payments, according to the Commissioner for Entrepreneurs’ Rights.\nSouthern and Eastern Mediterranean\nIn Jordan, the government introduced measures to support a partial postponement sales tax\nfor three months and early payments of employee salaries for companies affected by the\nrestrictions. Other initiatives are in place such as the one launched by Mercy Corps, a\nMicroMentor programme to support micro to medium-sized enterprises. Through the\nplatform, mentors assist and communicate with entrepreneurs whose work has been affected\nby the crisis. They provide assistance with financial planning, re-locating, applying for and\nmanaging loans and other forms of financing, diversifying income streams and increasing\nonline sales. In Lebanon, the government took office on 11 February 2020, with a mission to\n‘rescue’ the country from its financial and economic crisis through key reforms. Since then,\nand after a five-week suspension of legislative sessions, Parliament convened twice in April\nand May for two legislative sessions to respond to the repercussions of the pandemic and\nthe worsening financial crisis. The Chamber of Commerce has contributed to consultations\nwith the Central Bank to initiate a financial support scheme for companies. Accordingly, the\nCentral Bank has issued a resolution which allows banks to grant exceptional liability, on\npreviously granted loans for companies at 0% interest for the next five months. This\nresolution started in May 2020 and is helping to ensure continuity in the payments of\noperational expenses for companies, staff salaries included. Furthermore, the ‘Lebanese \nEconomy Oxygen Fund’ was launched in April in coordination with the Association of\nLebanese Industrialists and the Ministry of Industry. In Morocco, multiple measures have\nbeen adopted by the government to mitigate the financial impact of the crisis: suspending\nsocial contributions, delaying income tax payments, allowing a moratorium on bank interest\nfor certain categories of companies. In Egypt, the EBRD provided QNB Alahli, Egypt’s\nsecond-largest private bank, with a USD 100m financial aid package for the companies most\naffected, in particular SMEs, as part of the EBRD’s COVID-19 Solidarity Package. Also, the\n‘Egypt will pass’ initiative was launched by the Ministry of Planning and Economic\nDevelopment together with the Terous Misr Foundation to encourage the private sector to\nmaintain employment. Israel introduced incentives to companies that commit to keeping on\nat least 70% of employees and subsidised unpaid leave. In Palestine6\n, the Palestine\nMonetary Authority (PMA), in coordination with the Prime Minister, announced a package of\nbanking facilities for the private sector and the business sector, which include for example\npostponing the monthly payments of all borrowers from the banks, directing new credit to\nSMEs and startups, granting temporary credit limits to clients, and setting up a USD 300\nmillion support package for support SMEs.\nCentral Asia\nAs a priority, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have taken measures to\nimprove and ready their health systems and support macro-economic stability. All countries\nhave introduced a mix of tax relief and deferral, with some also introducing special measures\nfor SMEs or specific sectors (KZ and UZ). Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have\ndeveloped national plans or funds to channel support measures. However, only Kazakhstan\nand Uzbekistan have so far been able to set up comprehensive anti-crisis packages\n(amounting to 9% of GDP for Kazakhstan and 1.5% of GDP for Uzbekistan) that support both\nemployment and specifically also target SMEs and entrepreneurship. In Kazakhstan, the\ngovernment increased the volume of state guarantees for SMEs and introduced a threemonth tax exemption measure. Furthermore, additional measures were introduced for SMEs\nengaged in the most affected sectors of the economy, including catering, transport services,\nconsulting services, hospitality business, tourism, and others.\nB.
